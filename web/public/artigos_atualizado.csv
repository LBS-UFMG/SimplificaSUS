Lack of Association of Baseline 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels and Cholecalciferol Treatment With Disease Severity and Mortality in Indian Patients Hospitalized for Covid-19.	https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-129238/v1	28/12/2020	Preprint	10.21203/rs.3.rs-129238/v1	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Vitamina D (25-hidroxivitamina D)']	['Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D)']	Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) owing to its immunomodulatory effects is believed to influence outcomes in COVID-19. We conducted a prospective, observational study of patients, hospitalized with COVID-19. Serum 25-OHD level < 20 ng/mL was considered VDD. Patients were classified as having mild and severe disease on basis of the WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement (OSCI). Of the 410 patients recruited, patients with VDD (197,48.2%) were significantly younger and had lesser comorbidities. The levels of PTH were significantly higher in the VDD group (63.5 ± 54.4 vs. 47.5 ± 42.9 pg/mL). The proportion of severe cases (13.2% vs.14.6%), mortality (2% vs. 5.2%), oxygen requirement (34.5% vs.43.4%), ICU admission (14.7% vs.19.8%) was not significantly different between patients with or without VDD. There was no significant correlation between serum 25-OHD levels and inflammatory markers studied. Serum parathormone levels correlated with D-dimer (r 0.117, p- 0.019), ferritin (r 0.132, p-0.010), and LDH (r 0.124, p-0.018). Amongst VDD patients, 128(64.9%) were treated with oral cholecalciferol (median dose of 60,000 IU). The proportion of severe cases, oxygen, or ICU admission was not significantly different in the treated vs. untreated group. In conclusion, serum 25-OHD levels at admission did not correlate with inflammatory markers, clinical outcomes, or mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Treatment of VDD with cholecalciferol did not make any difference to the outcomes.	33737631	Scientific reports	2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-021-85809-y

Credible learning of hydroxychloroquine and dexamethasone effects on COVID-19 mortality outside of randomized trials.	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.06.20244798	08/12/2020	Preprint	10.1101/2020.12.06.20244798	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Dexametasona', 'Dexametasona', 'Hidroxicloroquina', 'Hidroxicloroquina']	['Dexamethasone', 'Dexamethasone', 'Hydroxychloroquine', 'Hydroxychloroquine']	The assumptions required for a beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine on 14 day mortality are difficult to sustain, while the assumptions required for hydroxychloroquine to be harmful are difficult to reject with confidence. Dexamethasone, by contrast, was beneficial under a wide range of plausible assumptions, and was only harmful if a nearly impossible assumption is met. More broadly, the SCQE reveals what inferences can be credibly supported by evidence from non-randomized uses of experimental therapies, making it a useful tool when randomized trials have not yet produced clear evidence or to provide corroborative evidence from different populations.	33330889	medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences	1527-2966	10.1101/2020.12.06.20244798

A Phase 1: Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of an Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine-BBV152.	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.11.20210419	15/12/2020	Preprint	10.1101/2020.12.11.20210419	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Covaxin']	['Covaxin']	Safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 for children are urgently needed. Here we aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidate, WIBP-CorV, in participants aged 3-17 years. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial was conducted in Henan Province, China, in healthy children aged 3-17 years. 240 participants in phase 1 trial and 576 participants in phase 2 trial were randomly assigned to vaccine or control with an age de-escalation in three cohorts (3-5, 6-12 and 13-17 years) and dose-escalation in three groups (2.5, 5.0 and 10.0μg/dose), and received 3 intramuscular injections at day 0, 28, and 56. WIBP-CorV showed a promising safety profile with approximately 17% adverse reactions within 30 days after injection and no grade 3 or worse adverse events. The most common adverse reaction was injection site pain, followed by fever, which were mild and self-limiting. The geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibody ranged from 102.2 to 1065.5 in vaccinated participants at 28 days after the third vaccination, and maintained at a range of 14.3 to 218.2 at day 180 after the third vaccination. WIBP-CorV elicited significantly higher titers of neutralizing antibody in the cohort aged 3-5 years than the other two cohorts. There were no detectable antibody responses in all alum-only groups. Taken together, our data demonstrate that WIBP-CorV is safe and well tolerated at all tested doses in participants aged 3-17 years, and elicited robust humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 lasted for at least 6 months after the third vaccination.

Early initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation for prevention of COVID-19 mortality: a nationwide cohort study of hospitalized patients in the United States.	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.09.20246579	11/12/2020	Preprint	10.1101/2020.12.09.20246579	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Anticoagulantes', 'Anticoagulantes']	['Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulants']	Early initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation compared with no anticoagulation among patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 was associated with a decreased risk of 30 day mortality and no increased risk of serious bleeding events. These findings provide strong real world evidence to support guidelines recommending the use of prophylactic anticoagulation as initial treatment for patients with covid-19 on hospital admission.	33574135	BMJ (Clinical research ed.)	1756-1833	10.1136/bmj.n311

Acute respiratory distress syndrome happened in COVID-19 not just because of uncontrolled viral replication but also because of an uncontrolled immune reaction from the host. That's why antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments have become an increasing concern for clinicians.

We undertook an individual patient-level meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in humans to describe viral dynamics and estimate the effects of antivirals used to date. This systematic review identified case reports, case series, and clinical trial data from publications between January 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards (Cox-PH) regression model of time to viral clearance was fitted to respiratory and stool samples. A simplified four parameter nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) model was fitted to viral load trajectories in all sampling sites and covariate modeling of respiratory viral dynamics was performed to quantify time-dependent drug effects. Patient-level data from 645 individuals (age 1 month to 100 years) with 6,316 viral loads were extracted. Model-based simulations of viral load trajectories in samples from the upper and lower respiratory tract, stool, blood, urine, ocular secretions, and breast milk were generated. Cox-PH modeling showed longer time to viral clearance in older patients, men, and those with more severe disease. Remdesivir was associated with faster viral clearance (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 9.19, P < 0.001), as well as interferon, particularly when combined with ribavirin (AHR = 2.2, P = 0.015; AHR = 6.04, P = 0.006). Combination therapy should be further investigated. A viral dynamic dataset and NLME model for designing and analyzing antiviral trials has been established.	33641159	Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics	1532-6535	10.1002/cpt.2223

In this study, we describe a protein nanoparticle vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine is based on the display of coronavirus spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) on a synthetic virus-like particle (VLP) platform, SpyCatcher003-mi3, using SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology. Low doses of RBD-SpyVLP in a prime-boost regimen induce a strong neutralising antibody response in mice and pigs that is superior to convalescent human sera. We evaluate antibody quality using ACE2 blocking and neutralisation of cell infection by pseudovirus or wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Using competition assays with a monoclonal antibody panel, we show that RBD-SpyVLP induces a polyclonal antibody response that recognises key epitopes on the RBD, reducing the likelihood of selecting neutralisation-escape mutants. Moreover, RBD-SpyVLP is thermostable and can be lyophilised without losing immunogenicity, to facilitate global distribution and reduce cold-chain dependence. The data suggests that RBD-SpyVLP provides strong potential to address clinical and logistic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.	33483491	Nature communications	2041-1723	10.1038/s41467-020-20654-7

This nonspecific immunity gained our interest, especially after initial reports of less cases in countries with universal BCG vaccination. In hopes of possible protective immunity, all staff of the Emirates International Hospital (United Arab Emirates) were offered a booster BCG vaccine in early March 2020. All the hospital staff were then tested for Covid-19 infection by the end of June 2020. We divided the subjects into two groups: booster vaccinated versus unvaccinated. The rate of Covid-19 infection was compared between the groups. Criteria included all staff who were offered the vaccine. Seventy-one subjects received the booster vaccination. This group had zero cases of positive COVID 19 infection. Two hundred nine subjects did not receive the vaccination, with 18 positive PCR confirmed COVID 19 cases. The infection rate in the unvaccinated group was 8.6% versus zero in the booster vaccinated group (Fisher's exact test 	34403297	Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics	2164-554X	10.1080/21645515.2021.1956228

The IL-6 receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody tocilizumab has been repurposed for COVID-19, but prospective trials and dose-finding studies in COVID-19 have not yet fully reported. We conducted a single-arm phase II trial of low-dose tocilizumab in nonintubated hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19, radiographic pulmonary infiltrate, fever, and C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 40 mg/L. We hypothesized that doses significantly lower than the emerging standards of 400 mg or 8 mg/kg would resolve clinical and laboratory indicators of hyperinflammation. A dose range from 40 to 200 mg was evaluated, with allowance for one repeat dose at 24 to 48 hours. The primary objective was to assess the relationship of dose to fever resolution and CRP response. Thirty-two patients received low-dose tocilizumab, with the majority experiencing fever resolution (75%) and CRP decline consistent with IL-6 pathway abrogation (86%) in the 24-48 hours following drug administration. There was no evidence of a relationship between dose and fever resolution or CRP decline over the dose range of 40-200 mg. Within the 28-day follow-up, 5 (16%) patients died. For patients who recovered, median time to clinical recovery was 3 days (interquartile range, 2-5). Clinically presumed and/or cultured bacterial superinfections were reported in 5 (16%) patients. Low-dose tocilizumab was associated with rapid improvement in clinical and laboratory measures of hyperinflammation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Results of this trial provide rationale for a randomized, controlled trial of low-dose tocilizumab in COVID-19.	33210302	Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics	1532-6535	10.1002/cpt.2117

This cascade affects drug concentrations in the plasma. We investigated the association between lopinavir (LPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plasma concentrations and the levels of the acute-phase inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP). LPV plasma concentrations in 92 patients hospitalized at our institution were prospectively collected. Lopinavir-ritonavir was administered every 12 hours, 800/200 mg on day 1 and 400/100 mg on day 2 until day 5 or 7. HCQ was given at 800 mg, followed by 400 mg after 6, 24, and 48 h. Hematological, liver, kidney, and inflammation laboratory values were analyzed on the day of drug level determination. The median age of study participants was 59 (range, 24 to 85) years, and 71% were male. The median durations from symptom onset to hospitalization and treatment initiation were 7 days (interquartile range [IQR], 4 to 10) and 8 days (IQR, 5 to 10), respectively. The median LPV trough concentration on day 3 of treatment was 26.5 μg/ml (IQR, 18.9 to 31.5). LPV plasma concentrations positively correlated with CRP values (	32641296	Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy	1098-6596	10.1128/AAC.01177-20

In the framework of such attempts, in a number of in vitro, as well as in vivo, models it was shown that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has an effect against SARS-CoV-2. While there were not enough clinical data to support the use of HCQ, several countries including Russia have included HCQ in treatment protocols for infected patients and for prophylaxis. In the current non-randomized, observational study we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharynx swabs from infected patients 7-10 days post symptoms with clinically mild disease and compared the viral RNA load dynamics between patients receiving HCQ (200 mg twice per day according to the Ministry of Health of Russian Federation treatment instructions, n = 33) and a control group without antiviral pharmacological therapy (n = 12). We found a statistically significant relationship between maximal RNA quantity and deterioration of patients' medical conditions, and as well we confirmed arterial hypertension to be a risk factor for people with COVID-19. However, we showed that at the dose used in the study HCQ therapy neither shortened the viral shedding period nor reduced the virus RNA load.	33513195	PloS one	1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0246396

However, how autophagy influences cancer-associated immunosuppression in BC remains undetermined. In this study, we observed a negative correlation between the autophagy-related markers LC3-II and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in BC cells. The autophagy inhibitors chloroquine (CQ) and bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1) increased PD-L1 expression in BC cells through the ERK-JNK-c-Jun signal-transduction pathway. Moreover, the treatment of BC cells with CQ and Baf-A1 inhibited hsa-microRNA-34a (miR-34a) expression and miR-34a overexpression in BC cells prevented the autophagy blockade-induced PD-L1 expression; a negative correlation between miR-34a and PD-L1 expression was observed during treatment with autophagy inhibitors. Furthermore, miR-34a overexpression induced the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells against BC cells. Our results provide evidence that autophagy blockade and its regulatory pathway affect cancer-associated immunosuppression through PD-L1 elevation. Thus, the coadministration of autophagy inhibitors and a PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade provides a potential therapeutic approach for treating BC.	33447849	QJM : monthly journal of the Association of Physicians	1460-2393	10.1093/qjmed/hcaa266

We linked anonymised health records from mental health services in Cambridgeshire (UK), for patients taking antipsychotic medication, with data from the local COVID-19 testing hub. Patients receiving clozapine were more likely to be tested for COVID-19, but not to test positive. Increased testing in patients receiving clozapine suggests prudent judgement by clinicians, considering the overall health vulnerabilities of this group.	35815763	BJPsych open	2056-4724	10.1192/bjo.2022.537

Self-limiting respiratory tract involvement, severe pneumonia, multiorgan failure and death are the spectrum of COVID-19. To date, there are no especial therapeutic agents for COVID-19 infections. One such medication includes the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which recently reported as a possible therapy for shortening the duration of COVID-19 symptoms, reducing inflammatory reactions to infection, impairing the exacerbation of pneumonia and boosting lung imaging findings. Like all medications, HCQ has side effects and may occur in COVID-19 patients.

Tocilizumab as a Therapeutic Agent for Critically Ill Patients Infected with SARS-CoV-2.	http://medrxiv.org/content/early/2020/06/08/2020.06.05.20122622.abstract	08/06/2020	Preprint	http://medrxiv.org/content/early/2020/06/08/2020.06.05.20122622.abstract	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Tocilizumabe']	['Tocilizumab']	Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor antagonist with the ability to suppress the cytokine storm in critically ill patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We evaluated patients treated with tocilizumab for a SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted between March 13, 2020, and April 16, 2020. This was a multicenter study with data collected by chart review both retrospectively and concurrently. Parameters evaluated included age, sex, race, use of mechanical ventilation (MV), usage of steroids and vasopressors, inflammatory markers, and comorbidities. Early dosing was defined as a tocilizumab dose administered prior to or within 1 day of intubation. Late dosing was defined as a dose administered > 1 day after intubation. In the absence of MV, the timing of the dose was related to the patient's date of admission only. We evaluated 145 patients. The average age was 58.1 years, 64% were men, 68.3% had comorbidities, and 60% received steroid therapy. Disposition of patients was 48.3% discharged and 29.3% died, of which 43.9% were African American. MV was required in 55.9%, of which 34.5% died. Avoidance of MV (P = 0.002) and increased survival (P < 0.001) was statistically associated with early dosing. Tocilizumab therapy was effective at decreasing mortality and should be instituted early in the management of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019) COVID-19).	32918792	Clinical and translational science	1752-8062	10.1111/cts.12894

A comparison study of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody between male and female COVID-19 patients: a possible reason underlying different outcome between gender	https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.20040709v1	27/04/2020	Preprint	10.1101/2020.03.26.20040709v1	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Anticorpo IgG']	['IgG antibody']	The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China at the end of 2019 has spread throughout the world and caused many thousands of deaths. The previous study reported a higher severe status rate and mortality rate in male patients in China. However, the reason underlying this difference has not been reported. The convalescent plasma containing a high level of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody has been used in clinical therapy and achieved good effects in China. In this study, to compare the differences of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody between male and female patients, a total number of 331 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. The serum of these patients was collected during hospitalization and detected for the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Our data showed that the concentration of IgG antibody in mild, general, and recovering patients showed no difference between male and female patients. In severe status, compared with male patients, there were more female patients having a relatively high concentration of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. In addition, the generation of IgG antibody in female patients was stronger than male patients in disease early phase. Our study identified a discrepancy in the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody level in male and female patients, which may be a potential cause leading to a different outcome of Coronavirus Disease 2019 between sex.	32383183	Journal of medical virology	1096-9071	10.1002/jmv.25989

Hydroxychloroquine is associated with slower viral clearance in clinical COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate disease: A retrospective study	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.20082180	02/05/2020	Preprint	10.1101/2020.04.27.20082180	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Hidroxicloroquina']	['Hydroxychloroquine']	There are conflicting data regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of HCQ in increasing SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance.Hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were retrospectively included in the study. The primary outcome was the time from a confirmed positive nasopharyngeal swab to turn negative. A negative nasopharyngeal swab conversion was defined as a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case followed by 2 negative results using RT-PCR assay with samples obtained 24 hours apart. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to adjust for potential confounders.Thirty-four confirmed COVID-19 patients completed the study. Nineteen (55.9%) patients presented with symptoms, and 14 (41.2%) had pneumonia. Only 21 (61.8%) patients received HCQ. The time to SARS-CoV-2 negativity nasopharyngeal test was significantly longer in patients who received HCQ than those who did not receive HCQ [17 (13-21) vs 10 (4-13) days, P = .023]. HCQ was independently associated with time to negativity test after adjustment for potential confounders (symptoms, comorbidities, antiviral drugs, pneumonia, or oxygen therapy) in multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (hazard ratio = 0.33, 95% confidence interval: 0.13-0.9, P = .024). On day 14, 47.8% (14/23) patients tested negative in the HCQ group compared with 90.9% (10/11) patients who did not receive HCQ (P = .016).HCQ was associated with a slower viral clearance in COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate disease. Data from ongoing randomized clinical trials with HCQ should provide a definitive answer regarding the efficacy and safety of this treatment.	33350752	Medicine	1536-5964	10.1097/MD.0000000000023720

Although vaccines exist against circulating influenza A viruses, such vaccines are ineffective against emerging pandemic influenza A viruses. Currently, no vaccine exists against coronavirus infections, including pandemic SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To combat these RNA virus infections, alternative antiviral strategies are needed. A key drug target is the viral RNA polymerase, which is responsible for viral RNA synthesis. In January 2020, the World Health Organisation identified enisamium as a candidate therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2. Enisamium is an isonicotinic acid derivative that is an inhibitor of multiple influenza B and A virus strains in cell culture and clinically approved in 11 countries.

Surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein are two important proteins of this virus facilitating its entry into host cell and genome replication. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a prospective tool of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway for the control of human viral infections by suppressing viral gene expression through hybridization and neutralization of target complementary mRNA. So, in this study, the power of RNA interference technology was harnessed to develop siRNA molecules against specific target genes namely, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene and surface glycoprotein gene. Conserved sequence from 139 SARS-CoV-2 strains from around the globe was collected to construct 78 siRNA that can inactivate nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein genes. Finally, based on GC content, free energy of folding, free energy of binding, melting temperature, efficacy prediction and molecular docking analysis, 8 siRNA molecules were selected which are proposed to exert the best action. These predicted siRNAs should effectively silence the genes of SARS-CoV-2 during siRNA mediated treatment assisting in the response against SARS-CoV-2.	33321203	Genomics	1089-8646	10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.12.021

Herein, we report that the FDA-approved drug, auranofin, inhibits SARS-COV-2 replication in human cells at low micro molar concentration. Treatment of cells with auranofin resulted in a 95% reduction in the viral RNA at 48 h after infection. Auranofin treatment dramatically reduced the expression of SARS-COV-2-induced cytokines in human cells. These data indicate that auranofin could be a useful drug to limit SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated lung injury due to its antiviral, anti-inflammatory and anti-reactive oxygen species (ROS) properties. Further animal studies are warranted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of auranofin for the management of SARS-COV-2 associated disease.	32442105	Virology	1096-0341	10.1016/j.virol.2020.05.002

Vaccine development is no doubt the best long-term immunological approach, but in the current epidemiologic and health emergency there is a need for rapid and effective solutions. Convalescent plasma is the only antibody-based therapy available for COVID-19 patients to date. Equine polyclonal antibodies (EpAbs) put forward a sound alternative. The new generation of processed and purified EpAbs containing highly purified F(ab')2 fragments demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated. EpAbs are easy to manufacture allowing a fast development and scaling up for a treatment. Based on these ideas, we present a new therapeutic product obtained after immunization of horses with the receptor-binding domain of the viral Spike glycoprotein. Our product shows around 50 times more potency in in vitro seroneutralization assays than the average of convalescent plasma. This result may allow us to test the safety and efficacy of this product in a phase 2/3 clinical trial to be conducted in July 2020 in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, Argentina.	32658841	Medicina	1669-9106	10.3389/fmicb.2022.888452

Intramuscular dosing of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and protects against lung infection, inflammation, and pathology but does not confer sterilizing immunity, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA and induction of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In contrast, a single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces high levels of neutralizing antibodies, promotes systemic and mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) and T cell responses, and almost entirely prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Intranasal administration of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S is a candidate for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission and curtailing pandemic spread.	32931734	Cell	1097-4172	10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.026
Optimization of hydroxychloroquine dosing scheme based on COVID-19 patients’ characteristics: a review of the literature and simulations	https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00498254.2020.1824301	16/09/2020	Estudo pré-clínico	10.1080/00498254.2020.1824301	0049-8254	00498254	XENOBIOTICA (LONDON. PRINT)	B1	0.403	82	1.83	-	['Hidroxicloroquina']	['Hydroxychloroquine']	During the recent COVID-19 outbreak hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been proposed as a safe and effective therapeutic option. However, a wide variety of dosing schemes has been applied in the clinical practice and tested in clinical studies. An extended literature survey was performed investigating the pharmacokinetics, the efficacy and safety of HCQ in COVID-19 treatment. Population pharmacokinetic models were retrieved from the literature and after evaluation and assessment one was selected in order to perform simulations. The most commonly applied dosing schemes were explored for patients with different weights and different levels of HCQ clearance impairment. Model-based simulations of HCQ concentrations revealed that high initial doses followed by low and sparse doses may offer significant benefits to patients by decreasing the viral load without reaching levels considered to produce adverse effects. For instance, the dosing scheme proposed for a 70 kg adult with moderate COVID-19 symptoms would be 600 mg upon diagnosis, 400 mg after 12 h, 300 mg after 24 h, 200 mg after 36 h, followed by 200 mg BID for 4 d, followed by 200 mg OD for 5 d. Based on the results from simulations performed and the currently published knowledge regarding HCQ in COVID-19 treatment, this study provides evidence that a high loading dose followed by sparse doses could offer significant benefits to the patients.	32933365	Xenobiotica; the fate of foreign compounds in biological systems	1366-5928	10.1080/00498254.2020.1824301
A Simple Bayesian Method for Evaluating Whether Data From Patients With Rheumatic Diseases Who Have Been Under Chronic Hydroxychloroquine Medication Since Before the COVID-19 Outbreak Can Speak to Hydroxychloroquine’s Prophylactic Effect Against Infection With SARS-CoV-2	https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2020.00490/full	13/08/2020	Estudo pré-clínico	10.3389/fmed.2020.00490/full	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Hidroxicloroquina']	['Hydroxychloroquine']	No vaccine against infection by SARS-CoV-2 yet exists. Treatment by hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) medication, among others, has been proposed. However, prophylactic HCQ medication has been little evaluated. We propose to use data from patients with rheumatic diseases (RA, SLR) who have been chronically taking HCQ medication since before the COVID-19 outbreak (hereafter: HCQpa), in order to evaluate the potential of HCQ for preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2. This can be achieved with relative ease by considering whether COVID-19 prevalence is significantly lower in HCQpa than in the general population (i.e., all people that are not HCQpa). Even if COVID-19 prevalence is truly significantly lower in HCQpa, some HCQpa may still present with COVID-19 (lower prevalence does not mean a prevalence of zero). However, given a value for COVID-19 prevalence in the general population and a number of available HCQpa, one may compute the maximum number of HCQpa for that total number of HCQpa considered that can have COVID-19 in order to still be able to conclude a lower COVID-19 prevalence in HCQpa (i.e., if there is one more case of COVID-19 than that maximum number, the COVID-19 prevalence in the HCQpa cannot be said to be lower than in the general population). Because the COVID-19 prevalence in the general population is not known with precision, we will consider different general population prevalence values. Among these contemplated prevalence values, one is derived from the official total number of confirmed cases, others by computing the total number of cases from the number of fatal COVID-19 cases so far and considering different case fatality rates per total cases. Our analyses show that systematic testing for COVID-19 in as few as 5,000 HCQpa is all that is needed for a test of whether HCQ has a prophylactic action against COVID-19, even for a COVID-19 prevalence value as low as 250 per 100,000, provided that test sensitivity is at least equal to its specificity. For higher COVID-19 prevalence values, the number of HCQpa needed is even lower.	32903552	Frontiers in medicine	2296-858X	10.3389/fmed.2020.00490
A single dose of an adenovirus-vectored vaccine provides protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17972-1	14/08/2020	Estudo pré-clínico	10.1038/s41467-020-17972-1	2041-1723	20411723	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS	A1	4.846	410	15.82	 Abstract The unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has created a worldwide public health emergency, and there is an urgent need to develop an effective vaccine to control this severe infectious disease. Here, we find that a single vaccination with a replication-defective human type 5 adenovirus encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Ad5-nCoV) protect mice completely against mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Additionally, a single vaccination with Ad5-nCoV protects ferrets from wild-type SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper respiratory tract. This study suggests that the mucosal vaccination may provide a desirable protective efficacy and this delivery mode is worth further investigation in human clinical trials.

Here, we report the generation of a replication-incompetent recombinant serotype 5 adenovirus, Ad5-S-nb2, carrying a codon-optimized gene encoding Spike protein (S). In mice and rhesus macaques, intramuscular injection with Ad5-S-nb2 elicits systemic S-specific antibody and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses. Intranasal inoculation elicits both systemic and pulmonary antibody responses but weaker CMI response. At 30 days after a single vaccination with Ad5-S-nb2 either intramuscularly or intranasally, macaques are protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge.

Here, we report isolation of four human-origin monoclonal antibodies from a convalescent patient, all of which display neutralization abilities. The antibodies B38 and H4 block binding between the spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD) of the virus and the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A competition assay indicated different epitopes on the RBD for these two antibodies, making them a potentially promising virus-targeting monoclonal antibody pair for avoiding immune escape in future clinical applications. Moreover, a therapeutic study in a mouse model validated that these antibodies can reduce virus titers in infected lungs. The RBD-B38 complex structure revealed that most residues on the epitope overlap with the RBD-ACE2 binding interface, explaining the blocking effect and neutralizing capacity. Our results highlight the promise of antibody-based therapeutics and provide a structural basis for rational vaccine design.	32404477	Science (New York, N.Y.)	1095-9203	10.1126/science.abc2241

Salvage use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 in the USA: a Markov decision analysis	https://wjes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13017-020-00305-4	20/04/2020	Estudo pré-clínico	https://wjes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13017-020-00305-4	1749-7922	17497922	WORLD JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY SURGERY	A1	1.736	51	7.7	 Abstract  Background COVID-19 threatens to quickly overwhelm our existing critical care infrastructure in the USA. Systemic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been previously demonstrated to improve PaO 2/FiO 2 (mmHg) when given to critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is unclear to what extent tPA may impact population-based survival during the current US COVID-19 pandemic.  Methods A decision analytic Markov state transition model was created to simulate the life critically ill COVID-19 patients as they transitioned to either recovery or death. Two patient groups were simulated (50,000 patients in each group); (1) Patients received tPA immediately upon diagnosis of ARDS and (2) patients received standard therapy for ARDS. Base case critically ill COVID-19 patients were defined as having a refractory PaO 2/FiO 2 of &lt; 60 mmHg (salvage use criteria). Transition from severe to moderate to mild ARDS, recovery, and death were estimated. Markov model parameters were extracted from existing ARDS/COVID-19 literature.  Results The use of tPA was associated with reduced mortality (47.6% [tTPA] vs. 71.0% [no tPA]) for base case patients. When extrapolated to the projected COVID-19 eligible for salvage use tPA in the USA, peak mortality (deaths/100,000 patients) was reduced for both optimal social distancing (70.5 [tPA] vs. 75.0 [no tPA]) and no social distancing (158.7 [tPA] vs. 168.8 [no tPA]) scenarios.  Conclusions Salvage use of tPA may improve recovery of ARDS patients, thereby reducing COVID-19-related mortality and ensuring sufficient resources to manage this pandemic.

It is very efficient to apply computer-aided drug design techniques to quickly identify promising drug repurposing candidates, especially after the detailed 3D-structures of key virous proteins are resolved. Taking the advantage of a recently released crystal structure of COVID-19 protease in complex with a covalently-bonded inhibitor, N3,<sup>1</sup> I conducted virtual docking screening of approved drugs and drug candidates in clinical trials. For the top docking hits, I then performed molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using an endpoint method called MM-PBSA-WSAS.<sup>2-4</sup> Several promising known drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of COVID-19 protease, including Carfilzomib, Eravacycline, Valrubicin, Lopinavir and Elbasvir. Carfilzomib, an approved anti-cancer drug acting as a proteasome inhibitor, has the best MM-PBSA-WSAS binding free energy, -13.82 kcal/mol. Streptomycin, an antibiotic and a charged molecule, also demonstrates some inhibitory effect, even though the predicted binding free energy of the charged form (-3.82 kcal/mol) is not nearly as low as that of the neutral form (-7.92 kcal/mol). One bioactive, PubChem 23727975, has a binding free energy of -12.86 kcal/mol. Detailed receptor-ligand interactions were analyzed and hot spots for the receptor-ligand binding were identified. I found that one hotspot residue HIS41, is a conserved residue across many viruses including COVID-19, SARS, MERS, and HCV. The findings of this study can facilitate rational drug design targeting the COVID-19 protease.	32510523	ChemRxiv : the preprint server for chemistry	2573-2293	10.26434/chemrxiv.11875446.v1

Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) play essential roles in viral RNA synthesis, and thus remains the target of choice for the prophylactic or curative treatment of several viral diseases, due to high sequence and structural conservation. To date, the most promising broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleoside analogues (NAs), with over 25 approved for the treatment of several medically important viral diseases. However, Coronaviruses stand out as a particularly challenging case for NA drug design due to the presence of an exonuclease (ExoN) domain capable of excising incorporated NAs and thus providing resistance to many of these available antivirals. Here we use the available structures of the SARS-CoV RdRp and ExoN proteins, as well as Lassa virus N exonuclease to derive models of catalytically competent SARS-CoV-2 enzymes. We then map a promising NA candidate, GS-441524 (the active metabolite of Remdesivir) to the nucleoside active site of both proteins, identifying the residues important for nucleotide recognition, discrimination, and excision. Interestingly, GS-441524 addresses both enzyme active sites in a manner consistent with significant incorporation, delayed chain termination, and altered excision due to the ribose 1'-CN group, which may account for the increased antiviral effect compared to other available analogues. Additionally, we propose structural and function implications of two previously identified RdRp resistance mutations in relation to resistance against Remdesivir.

There is no approved drug or vaccine for COVID-19, although more than 10 clinical trials have been launched to test potential drugs. In an urgent response to this pandemic, I developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify compounds and drug candidates to potentially treat COVID-19. This pipeline is based on publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and the drug perturbation database "Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures" (LINCS). I developed a ranking score system that prioritizes these drugs or small molecules. The four drugs with the highest total score are didanosine, benzyl-quinazolin-4-yl-amine, camptothecin, and RO-90-7501. In conclusion, I have demonstrated the utility of bioinformatics for identifying drugs than can be repurposed for potentially treating COVID-19 patients.	32291351	mSystems	2379-5077	10.1128/mSystems.00297-20

Replication of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the likely target of the investigational nucleotide analogue remdesivir (RDV). RDV shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against RNA viruses, and previous studies with RdRps from Ebola virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have revealed that delayed chain termination is RDV's plausible mechanism of action. Here, we expressed and purified active SARS-CoV-2 RdRp composed of the nonstructural proteins nsp8 and nsp12. Enzyme kinetics indicated that this RdRp efficiently incorporates the active triphosphate form of RDV (RDV-TP) into RNA.

We evaluated the in vitro antiviral effect of compounds that were previously reported to inhibit coronavirus replication and compounds that are currently under evaluation in clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 patients. We report the antiviral effect of remdesivir, lopinavir, homorringtonine, and emetine against SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells with the estimated 50% effective concentration at 23.15 μM, 26.63 μM, 2.55 μM and 0.46 μM, respectively. Ribavirin or favipiravir that are currently evaluated under clinical trials showed no inhibition at 100 μM. Synergy between remdesivir and emetine was observed, and remdesivir at 6.25 μM in combination with emetine at 0.195 μM may achieve 64.9% inhibition in viral yield. Combinational therapy may help to reduce the effective concentration of compounds below the therapeutic plasma concentrations and provide better clinical benefits.	32251767	Antiviral research	1872-9096	10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104786

Risk of metformin in type 2 diabetes patients with COVID-19: a preliminary retrospective report	https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cts.12897	21/09/2020	Comunicação breve	10.1111/cts.12897	1752-8054	17528054	Clinical and Translational Science	-	1.162	48	4.64	-	['Metformina']	['Metformin']	The current outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has spread across the world. No specific antiviral agents have been adequately evidenced for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although metformin has been recommended as a host-directed therapy for COVID-19, there are some opposite views. The effects of metformin on the disease severity of patients with COVID-19 with diabetes during hospitalization remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the effect of metformin on disease severity. We enrolled 110 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with diabetes prescribed either metformin or non-metformin hypoglycemic treatment for a case-control study. The primary outcome was the occurrence of life-threatening complications. There were no differences between the two groups in age, sex, comorbidities, and clinical severity at admission. Blood glucose and lactate dehydrogenase levels of the metformin group were higher than those of the non-metformin group at admission. Other laboratory parameters at admission and treatments after admission were not different between the two groups. Strikingly, the percentage of patients who experienced life-threatening complications was significantly higher in the metformin group (28.6% (16/56) vs. 7.4% (4/54), P = 0.004). Antidiabetic therapy with metformin was associated with a higher risk of disease progression in patients with COVID-19 with diabetes during hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio = 3.964, 95% confidence interval 1.034-15.194, P = 0.045). This retrospective analysis suggested a potential safety signal for metformin, the use of which was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19. We propose that metformin withdrawal in patients with COVID-19 be considered to prevent disease progression.	32955785	Clinical and translational science	1752-8062	10.1111/cts.12897

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was hypothesized to be active against SARS-CoV2 via antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect; however, HCQ for COVID-19 in clinical use remained debating. In this preliminary report, we presented six patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. They were treated with HCQ for 14 days from the day of COVID-19 diagnosis. Serial viral load from respiratory specimens were performed every other day. Cytokine profile was checked before HCQ initiation and on the 14th day of HCQ treatment. All patients receiving HCQ completed 14-day course without complication. Among the six patients, the mean duration from symptom onset to last detectable viral load was 34 ± 12 days, which was similar to those without specific treatment in previous reports. Low level of interferon-gamma was noted in all patients of different stage of infection and three patients had elevation of IL-17 level. Prolonged virus shedding is still observed regardless HCQ. The impact of HCQ on cytokine kinetics remained unclear; however, IL-17 could be an inflammatory marker for disease status monitor and a potential therapeutic target.	32888840	Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi	0929-6646	10.1016/j.jfma.2020.08.022

However, not all drugs prolonging QT interval are proarrhythmic. This study aimed to characterize cellular and tissue mechanisms under which QT-interval prolonging drugs and their combination are proarrhythmic, examining arrhythmia susceptibility due to action potential (AP) triangulation and spatial dispersion of action potential duration (APD). Additionally, we aimed to elucidate that Torsades de Pointe (TdP) associated with long-QT are not necessarily caused by early-after-depolarization (EADs) but are related to the presence of AP alternans in both time and space. Isolated Guinea Pig hearts were Langendorff perfused, and optical mapping was done with a voltage dye-sensitive dye. Two commonly used drugs at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Azithromycin (AZM), were added to study the effects of QT interval prolongation. Alternans in time and space were characterized by performing restitution pacing protocols. Comparing APs, HCQ prolongs APD during phase-III repolarization, resulting in a higher triangulation ratio than AZM alone or AZM combined with HCQ. Lower triangulation ratios with AZM are associated with phase-II prolongation, lower arrhythmia, and lower incidence of spatially discordant alternans.	32347963	Swiss medical weekly	1424-3997	Swiss Med Wkly. 2020;150:w20262

CD147 as a Target for COVID-19 Treatment: Suggested Effects of Azithromycin and Stem Cell Engagement	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167302/	20/04/2020	Carta do editor	PMC:PMC7167302/	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Azitromicina']	['Azithromycin']	The expressive number of deaths and confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 call for an urgent demand of effective and available drugs for COVID-19 treatment. CD147, a receptor on host cells, is a novel route for SARS-CoV-2 invasion. Thus, drugs that interfere in the spike protein/CD147 interaction or CD147 expression may inhibit viral invasion and dissemination among other cells, including in progenitor/stem cells. Studies suggest beneficial effects of azithromycin in reducing viral load of hospitalized patients, possibly interfering with ligand/CD147 receptor interactions; however, its possible effects on SARS-CoV-2 invasion has not yet been evaluated. In addition to the possible effect in invasion, azithromycin decreases the expression of some metalloproteinases (downstream to CD147), induces anti-viral responses in primary human bronchial epithelial infected with rhinovirus, decreasing viral replication and release. Moreover, resident lung progenitor/stem are extensively differentiated into myofibroblasts during pulmonary fibrosis, a complication observed in COVID-19 patients. This process, and the possible direct viral invasion of progenitor/stem cells via CD147 or ACE2, could result in the decline of these cellular stocks and failing lung repair. Clinical tests with allogeneic MSCs from healthy individuals are underway to enhance endogenous lung repair and suppress inflammation.	32307653	Stem cell reviews and reports	2629-3277	10.1007/s12015-020-09976-7

To date, the pathogenic mechanism of this novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is still unclear, and there is no effective treatment. As one of the most effective strategies to prevent viral infection, vaccines have become a research hotspot. Based on the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the research and development of its vaccines cover almost all forms of current vaccine research, including inactivated vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, viral vector vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines. Moreover, with the spread of the new mutant virus, it is necessary to evaluate the protection rate of previous administered vaccines. This article reviews the candidate targets, vaccine types, research and development status, progress of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 mutants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.617.2, and B.1.1.529) induced by these vaccines, to provide a reference for follow-up research and prevention.	32728733	Rheumatology (Oxford, England)	1462-0332	10.1093/rheumatology/keaa388

Understanding of these abnormalities is continually evolving, but these conditions may pose a risk to patients with COVID-19 beyond the risk typically seen in critically ill patients.                                                  Summary                   There are currently no widely accepted evidence-based guidelines regarding specifics related to treatment and prevention of COVID-19–related coagulopathies. Areas of management requiring clinical equipoise include agent selection and dosing, continuation vs interruption of home oral anticoagulant therapy during hospital admission, and postdischarge VTE prophylaxis. Clinicians may wish to consider use of a stratified, 3-tiered approach of low-intensity anticoagulation, intermediate-intensity anticoagulation, and therapeutic-dose anticoagulation. Patients can be categorized by tier depending on their risk factors for VTE, acuity of illness, and laboratory values such as D-dimer level.

Since the suggestion that HCQ has potential for COVID-19, there have been varying responses from clinicians and healthcare institutions, ranging from adoption of protocols using HCQ for routine care to the conduct of randomised controlled trials to an effective system-wide prohibition on its use for COVID-19. In this article, we argue that the concept of 'disease public profile' has become a prominent, if not the sole, determinant in decision-making across various healthcare responses to the pandemic. In the case of COVID-19, the disease's public profile is based on clinical and non-clinical factors that include contagiousness, clinical presentation and media coverage. In particular, we briefly examine the dangers of a heightened public profile in magnifying the inequality of diseases and undermining three key ethical concepts, namely (1) evidence-based practice, (2) sustainable allocation and (3) meaningful consent.	32647045	Journal of medical ethics	1473-4257	10.1136/medethics-2020-106306

Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to massive release of pro-inflammatory mediators, leading to diffuse damage to lung parenchyma, and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Treatment with the highly potent glucocorticoid (GC), dexamethasone was found to be effective in reducing mortality in severely affected patients. In our review we discuss the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in critical illness, the selection of a specific GC in critical illness- related GC insufficiency and the recent studies which investigate the HPA dysfunction in Covid-19 patients. Additionally, we focus on the mechanisms of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of GCs, through their influence on innate and adaptive immune systems and relation of these effects in COVID-19. We also address the specific activation of the immune system with chronic endogenous glucocorticoid excess, as seen in patients with Cushing syndrome and finally we discuss the immune activation due to coronavirus infection and the possible mechanisms leading to improved outcomes of COVID-19 patients treated with GCs.	32546603	Annals of the rheumatic diseases	1468-2060	10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-218171

Innate and intrinsic immunity form the front-line natural antiviral defense. They involve both tissue-resident and circulating cells, which can produce anti-viral molecules shortly after viral infection. Prototypes of these factors are type I interferons (IFN), antiviral cytokines with a long record of clinical use. During the last two years, there has been an impressive progress in understanding the mechanisms of both SARS-CoV-2 infection and the cellular and soluble antiviral responses occurring early after viral exposure. However, this information was not sufficiently translated into therapeutic approaches. Insufficient type I IFN activity probably accounts for disease progression in many patients. This results from both the multiple interfering mechanisms developed by SARS-CoV-2 to decrease type I IFN response and various pre-existing human deficits of type I IFN activity, inherited or auto-immune. Emerging data suggest that IFN-I-mediated boosting of patients' immunity, achieved directly through the exogenous administration of IFN-β early post viral infection, or indirectly following inoculation of heterologous vaccines (e.g., Bacillus Calmette Guerin), might play a role against SARS-CoV-2. We review how recent insights on the viral and human determinants of critical COVID-19 pneumonia can foster clinical studies of IFN therapy. We also discuss how early therapeutic use of IFN-β and prophylactic campaigns with live attenuated vaccines might prevent a first wave of new pandemic viruses.	32505245	Lancet (London, England)	1474-547X	10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31252-6

Metformin in COVID-19: A possible role beyond diabetes	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108183	29/04/2020	Artigo de opinião	10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108183	0168-8227	01688227	DIABETES RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PRACTICE (PRINT)	A3	1.677	122	6.69	-	['Metformina']	['Metformin']	The global COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, which was caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a significant loss of human life around the world. The SARS-CoV-2 has caused significant problems to medical systems and healthcare facilities due to its unexpected global expansion. Despite all of the efforts, developing effective treatments, diagnostic techniques, and vaccinations for this unique virus is a top priority and takes a long time. However, the foremost step in vaccine development is to identify possible antigens for a vaccine. The traditional method was time taking, but after the breakthrough technology of reverse vaccinology (RV) was introduced in 2000, it drastically lowers the time needed to detect antigens ranging from 5-15 years to 1-2 years. The different RV tools work based on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Models based on AI and ML have shown promising solutions in accelerating the discovery and optimization of new antivirals or effective vaccine candidates. In the present scenario, AI has been extensively used for drug and vaccine research against SARS-COV-2 therapy discovery. This is more useful for the identification of potential existing drugs with inhibitory human coronavirus by using different datasets. The AI tools and computational approaches have led to speedy research and the development of a vaccine to fight against the coronavirus. Therefore, this paper suggests the role of artificial intelligence in the field of clinical trials of vaccines and clinical practices using different tools.	32360697	Diabetes research and clinical practice	1872-8227	10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108183

Besides the obvious concerns about limitation of virus spread and providing the best possible care to infected patients, a concomitant concern has now arisen in view of a putative link between the use of certain drugs, such as Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) inhibitors and ibuprofen, and an increased risk for COVID-19 infection. We here discuss this concern in relation to headache treatment and conclude that, based on current evidence, there is no reason to abandon treatment of headache patients with RAS inhibitors or ibuprofen.

Chloroquine for SARS-CoV-2: Implications of Its Unique Pharmacokinetic and Safety Properties	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40262-020-00891-1	18/04/2020	Artigo de opinião	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40262-020-00891-1	0312-5963	03125963	CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETICS	A1	1.274	169	5.4	-	['Cloroquina', 'Cloroquina', 'Cloroquina']	['Chloroquine', 'Chloroquine', 'Chloroquine']	Since in vitro studies and a preliminary clinical report suggested the efficacy of chloroquine for COVID-19-associated pneumonia, there is increasing interest in this old antimalarial drug. In this article, we discuss the pharmacokinetics and safety of chloroquine that should be considered in light of use in SARS-CoV-2 infections. Chloroquine is well absorbed and distributes extensively resulting in a large volume of distribution with an apparent and terminal half-life of 1.6 days and 2 weeks, respectively. Chloroquine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 and renal clearance is responsible for one third of total clearance. The lack of reliable information on target concentrations or doses for COVID-19 implies that for both adults and children, doses that proved effective and safe in malaria should be considered, such as 'loading doses' in adults (30 mg/kg over 48 h) and children (70 mg/kg over 5 days), which reported good tolerability. Here, plasma concentrations were < 2.5 μmol/L, which is associated with (minor) toxicity. While the influence of renal dysfunction, critical illness, or obesity seems small, in critically ill patients, reduced absorption may be anticipated. Clinical experience has shown that chloroquine has a narrow safety margin, as three times the adult therapeutic dosage for malaria can be lethal when given as a single dose. Although infrequent, poisoning in children is extremely dangerous where one to two tablets can potentially be fatal. In conclusion, the pharmacokinetic and safety properties of chloroquine suggest that chloroquine can be used safely for an acute virus infection, under corrected QT monitoring, but also that the safety margin is small, particularly in children.	32306288	Clinical pharmacokinetics	1179-1926	10.1007/s40262-020-00891-1

The few trials that allow their inclusion focus on postexposure prophylaxis or outpatient treatment of milder disease, limiting the options available to pregnant women with severe COVID-19 to compassionate use of remdesivir, or off-label drug use of hydroxychloroquine or other therapies. These restrictions were put in place despite experience with these drugs in pregnant women. In this Viewpoint, we call attention to the need and urgency to engage pregnant women in COVID-19 treatment trials now in order to develop data-driven recommendations regarding the risks and benefits of therapies in this unique but not uncommon population.	32296817	Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America	1537-6591	10.1093/cid/ciaa444

Why tocilizumab could be an efective treatment for severe COVID-19?	https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02339-3	14/04/2020	Artigo de opinião	10.1186/s12967-020-02339-3	1479-5876	14795876	JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE (ONLINE)	A2	1.570	121	7.38	 Abstract A severe pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus was identified in December 2019 (COVID-19), spread rapidly and has become a world-wide public health challenge. About 25% of COVID-19 patients experienced severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even progressed into an intensive care unit (ICU) admission and died. The exploration for the mortality causes and advancing novel therapeutic development of severe COVID-19 is crucial at the moment. The biopsy samples analysis at autopsy suggested that increased alveolar exudate caused by aberrant host immune response and inflammatory cytokine storm probably impedes alveolar gas exchange and contributes to the high mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. Our research has identified that pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes incite inflammatory storm with large amount of interleukin 6, therefore monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 pathways may potentially curb inflammatory storm. Moreover, Tocilizumab treatment that blocking IL-6 receptors showed inspiring clinical results including temperature returned to normal quickly and respiratory function improved. Therefore, we suggest that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment in severe patients of COVID-19 to calm the inflammatory storm and reduce mortality.	['Tocilizumabe']	['Tocilizumab']	-	-	-	-	-

The array of injuries caused by this virus is broad and not limited to the respiratory system, but encompassing also extensive endothelial and systemic tissue damage. Since statins effectively improve endothelial function, these drugs may have beneficial effects in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, this investigation aimed to provide an updated overview on the interplay between statins and COVID-19, with particular focus on their potentially protective role against progression toward severe or critical illness and death. A systematic electronic search was performed in Scopus and PubMed up to present time. Data on statins use and COVID-19 outcomes especially in studies performed in Europe and North America were extracted and pooled. A total of seven studies met our inclusion criteria, totaling 2,398 patients (1,075 taking statins, i.e., 44.8%). Overall, statin usage in Western patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was associated with nearly 40% lower odds of progressing toward severe illness or death (odds ratio: 0.59; 95% confidence interval: 0.35-0.99). After excluding studies in which statin therapy was started during hospital admission, the beneficial effect of these drugs was magnified (odds ratio: 0.51; 95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.64). In conclusion, although randomized trials would be necessary to confirm these preliminary findings, current evidence would support a favorable effect of statins as adjuvant therapy in patients with COVID-19. Irrespective of these considerations, suspension of statin therapy seems highly unadvisable in COVID-19 patients.	32278373	Lancet (London, England)	1474-547X	10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30817-5

With no vaccines or drugs approved for prevention and treatment until now, all efforts at drug design and/or clinical trials of already approved drugs are worthy and creditable. Using structure-based drug selection for identification of SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors, old drugs such as macrolides (MAC) were predicted to be effective for COVID-19. Lately, the anti-viral effects of macrolides have attracted considerable attention. Very recently, hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin treatment was reported to be effective for COVID-19. We believe that treatments with macrolides alone or in combination with other drugs are promising and open the possibility of an international strategy to fight this emerging viral infection.	32249257	Bioscience trends	1881-7823	10.5582/bst.2020.03058

However, there is no evidence of its impact on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.  Methods In a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult patients presenting up to 3 days after onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms (dry cough, fever and/or fatigue) were enrolled. After confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection using reverse transcriptase PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab, patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either nitazoxanide (500 mg) or placebo, three times daily, for 5 days. The primary outcome was complete resolution of symptoms. Secondary outcomes were viral load, laboratory tests, serum biomarkers of inflammation and hospitalisation rate. Adverse events were also assessed.  Results From June 8 to August 20, 2020, 1575 patients were screened. Of these, 392 (198 placebo, 194 nitazoxanide) were analysed. Median (interquartile range) time from symptom onset to first dose of study drug was 5 (4–5) days. At the 5-day study visit, symptom resolution did not differ between the nitazoxanide and placebo arms. Swabs collected were negative for SARS-CoV-2 in 29.9% of patients in the nitazoxanide arm  versus 18.2% in the placebo arm (p=0.009). Viral load was reduced after nitazoxanide compared to placebo (p=0.006). The percentage viral load reduction from onset to end of therapy was higher with nitazoxanide (55%) than placebo (45%) (p=0.013). Other secondary outcomes were not significantly different. No serious adverse events were observed.  Conclusions In patients with mild COVID-19, symptom resolution did not differ between nitazoxanide and placebo groups after 5 days of therapy. However, early nitazoxanide therapy was safe and reduced viral load significantly.

We aimed to explore the role of hydroxychloroquine therapy in mildly symptomatic patients diagnosed in the outpatient setting.                                Methods                 We examined the association between outpatient hydroxychloroquine exposure and the subsequent progression of disease among mildly symptomatic non-hospitalized patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome assessed was requirement of hospitalization. Data was obtained from a retrospective review of electronic health records within a New Jersey USA multi-hospital network. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those who did not applying a multivariable logistic model with propensity matching.                                Results                 Among 1274 outpatients with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection 7.6% were prescribed hydroxychloroquine. In a 1067 patient propensity matched cohort, 21.6% with outpatient exposure to hydroxychloroquine were hospitalized, and 31.4% without exposure were hospitalized. In the primary multivariable logistic regression analysis with propensity matching there was an association between exposure to hydroxychloroquine and a decreased rate of hospitalization from COVID-19 (OR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29, 0.95). Sensitivity analyses revealed similar associations.

Corticosteroid treatment has no efect on hospital mortality in COVID‐19 patients.	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-80654-x	13/01/2021	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1038/s41598-020-80654-x	2045-2322	20452322	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS	A2	1.005	242	4.81	 Abstract Since the start of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, corticosteroid use has been the subject of debate. The available evidence is uncertain, and knowledge on the subject is evolving. The aim of our cohort study was to evaluate the association between corticosteroid therapy and hospital mortality, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 after balancing for possible confounders. One thousand four hundred forty four patients were admitted to our hospital with a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, 559 patients (39%) were exposed to corticosteroids during hospital stay, 844 (61%) were not exposed to corticosteroids. In the cohort of patients exposed to corticosteroids, 171 (30.6%) died. In the cohort of patients not exposed to corticosteroids, 183 (21.7%) died (unadjusted  p &lt; 0.001). Nonetheless, exposure to corticosteroids was not associated with in-hospital mortality after balancing with overlap weight propensity score (adjusted  p = 0.25). Patients in the corticosteroids cohort had a reduced risk of ICU admission (adjusted  p &lt; 0.001). Treatment with corticosteroids did not affect hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 after balancing for confounders. A possible advantage of corticosteroid therapy was to reduce Intensive Care Unit admission, which could be useful in reducing pressure on Intensive Care Units in times of limited resources, as during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The use of methylprednisolone in COVID-19 patients: A propensity score matched retrospective cohort study.	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244128	31/12/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1371/journal.pone.0244128	1932-6203	19326203	PLOS ONE	A1	0.852	367	3.8	<jats:sec id="sec001"> Purpose To evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone in treating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.<jats:sec id="sec002"> Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted, and all COVID-19 patients were recruited who were admitted to the Yichang Third People’s Hospital from February 1 st to March 31 st, 2020. One-to-one propensity score matching (PSM) was used for minimizing confounding effects. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, with the secondary outcomes being the time needed for a positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test to turn negative and the length of hospital stay.<jats:sec id="sec003"> Results Totaling 367 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at the Yichang Third People’s Hospital were identified, of whom 276 were mild or stable COVID-19, and 67 were serious or critically ill. Among them, 255 patients were treated using methylprednisolone, and 188 did not receive any corticosteroid-related treatment. After PSM, no statistically significant difference was found in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. Regarding the outcomes, there also were no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Patients without the use of methylprednisolone were more quickly to obtain negative results of their nasopharyngeal swab tests of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid after treatment, compared to those receiving methylprednisolone.<jats:sec id="sec004"> Conclusion Methylprednisolone could not improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19, and the efficacy and safety of the use of methylprednisolone in patients with COVID-19 still remain uncertain, thus the use of corticosteroids clinically in patients with COVID-19 should be with cautions.

The aim of the study was to analyze the effectiveness of convalescent plasma on COVID-19 patients. The study population consisted of 78 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, selected from the SARSTer national database, who received convalescent plasma. The impact on clinical and laboratory parameters was assessed. A clinical improvement was observed in 62 (79%) patients, and 10 (13%) patients died from COVID-19. No side effects of the convalescent plasma treatment were observed. When plasma was administered earlier than 7 days from diagnosis, the total hospitalization time was shorter (p &lt; 0.05). Plasma efficacy was inferior to remdesivir in endpoints such as the necessity and duration of oxygen therapy, the duration of hospitalization, and mortality rate, and inferior to other drugs in the case of the duration of hospitalization and the necessity of constant oxygen therapy, but comparable in most other measured endpoints. A comparison of a 30-day mortality rate in patients who received plasma and remdesivir (4/25, 16%) and who received only plasma (6/53, 11%) showed no significant difference. Convalescent plasma efficacy is inferior to remdesivir when treating COVID-19 patients but the addition of remdesivir to plasma does not improve the treatment effectiveness. In most endpoints, plasma was comparable to other treatment options. In our opinion, convalescent plasma may be used as a supportive treatment in COVID-19 patients because of the low frequency of adverse effects and availability, but must be given as early from the diagnosis as possible.

Cardiovascular Comorbidities and Pharmacological Treatments of COVID-19 Patients Not Requiring Hospitalization.	https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18010102	25/12/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18010102	1660-4601	16604601	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH	A2	0.814	138	4.7	 Introduction: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is a whole Earth health emergency related to a highly pathogenic human coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). Despite the fact that the majority of infected patients were managed in outpatient settings, little is known about the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization. The aim of our study was to describe the clinical comorbidity and the pharmacological therapies of COVID-19 patients managed in outpatient settings. Materials and Methods: We performed an observational, retrospective analysis of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients managed in outpatient settings in Naples, Italy between 9 March and 1 May 2020. Data were sourced from the prospectively maintained Health Search (HS)/Thales database, shared by 128 primary care physicians (PCPs) in Naples, Italy. The clinical features and pharmacological therapies of COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization and managed in outpatient settings have been described. Results: A total of 351 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients (mean age 54 ± 17 years; 193 males) with outpatient management were evaluated. Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity (35%). The distribution of cardiovascular comorbidities showed no gender-related differences. A total of 201 patients (57.3%) were treated with at least one experimental drug for COVID-19. Azithromycin, alone (42.78%) or in combination (27.44%), was the most widely used experimental anti-COVID drug in outpatient settings. Low Molecular Weight Heparin and Cortisone were prescribed in 24.87% and 19.4% of the study population, respectively. At multivariate regression model, diabetes (risk ratio (RR): 3.74; 95% CI 1.05 to 13.34; p = 0.04) and hypertension (RR: 1.69; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.7; p = 0.03) were significantly associated with the experimental anti-COVID drug administration. Moreover, only diabetes (RR: 2.43; 95% CI 1.01 to 5.8; p = 0.03) was significantly associated with heparin administration. Conclusions: Our data show a high prevalence of hypertension, more likely treated with renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RASS) inhibitors, among COVID-19 patients not requiring hospitalization. Experimental COVID-19 therapies have been prescribed to COVID-19 patients considered at risk for increased venous thromboembolism based on concomitant comorbidities, in particular diabetes and hypertension.

We retrospectively analyzed data of 280 hospitalized patients developing CRS initially. PSM was used to minimize bias from non-randomized treatment assignment. Using PSM 1:1, 90 patients were selected and assigned to 2 equal groups. Forced matching was done for disease severity, routine standard care and advanced supportive care. Many other Co-variates were matched. Primary outcome was 28 days overall survival. Secondary outcomes were duration of hospitalization, CRS resolution time and timing of viral clearance on Polymerase chain reaction testing.<jats:sec id="sec004"> Results After PS-matching, the selected cohort had a median age of 60 years (range 32–73 in TPE, 37–75 in controls), p = 0.325 and all were males.

Corticosteroids could attenuate this inappropriate response, although there are still some concerns regarding its use, timing, and dose.                                Methods                 This is a nationwide, prospective, multicenter, observational, cohort study in critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 admitted into Intensive Care Units (ICU) in Spain from 12th March to 29th June 2020. Using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting, we compared relevant outcomes between patients treated with early corticosteroids (before or within the first 48 h of ICU admission) with those who did not receive early corticosteroids (delayed group) or any corticosteroids at all (never group). Primary endpoint was ICU mortality. Secondary endpoints included 7-day mortality, ventilator-free days, and complications.                                Results                 A total of 691 patients out of 882 (78.3%) received corticosteroid during their hospital stay. Patients treated with early-corticosteroids (n = 485) had lower ICU mortality (30.3% vs. never 36.6% and delayed 44.2%) and lower 7-day mortality (7.2% vs. never 15.2%) compared to non-early treated patients. They also had higher number of ventilator-free days, less length of ICU stay, and less secondary infections than delayed treated patients. There were no differences in medical complications between groups. Of note, early use of moderate-to-high doses was associated with better outcomes than low dose regimens.                                Conclusion                 Early use of corticosteroids in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is associated with lower mortality than no or delayed use, and fewer complications than delayed use.

We conducted a retrospective study of all adult confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients who received combination of three doses of 12 million international units of IFN-β1-a and Lopinavir 400 mg and Ritonavir 100 mg every 12 h (case group) for 14 days besides standard care and age- and sex- matched COVID-19 patients with receiving lopinavir/ritonavir (control group) at Masih Daneshvari Hospital as a designated hospital for COVID-19 between Feb 19 and Apr 30, 2020. Multivariate analysis was done to determine the impact of IFN-β1-a on outcome and all-cause mortality. 152 cases in IFN-β1-a group and 304 cases as control group were included. IFN-β1-a group stayed at hospital longer and required noninvasive ventilation more than control group (13 vs. 6 days, p = 0.001) and (34% vs. 24%, p = 0.04), respectively. During treatment, 57 (12.5%) patients died. The death rate in case and control groups was 11% and 13% respectively. In multivariate analysis, not receiving IFN-β1-a (HR 5.12, 95% CI: 2.77-9.45), comorbidity (HR 2.28, 95% CI: 1.13-4.60) and noninvasive ventilation (HR 2.77, 95% CI: 1.56-4.93) remained significantly associated with all-cause mortality. In this study, risk of death decreased by using IFN-β1-a in COVID-19 patients.

Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells for COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome: A double-blind, phase 1/2a, randomized controlled trial.	https://stemcellsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sctm.20-0472	05/01/2021	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1002/sctm.20-0472	2157-6564	21576564	STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE	A1	1.412	80	7.67	 Abstract                Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 is associated with high mortality. Mesenchymal stem cells are known to exert immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects and could yield beneficial effects in COVID-19 ARDS. The objective of this study was to determine safety and explore efficacy of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) infusions in subjects with COVID-19 ARDS. A double-blind, phase 1/2a, randomized, controlled trial was performed. Randomization and stratification by ARDS severity was used to foster balance among groups. All subjects were analyzed under intention to treat design. Twenty-four subjects were randomized 1:1 to either UC-MSC treatment (n = 12) or the control group (n = 12). Subjects in the UC-MSC treatment group received two intravenous infusions (at day 0 and 3) of 100 ± 20 × 106 UC-MSCs; controls received two infusions of vehicle solution. Both groups received best standard of care. Primary endpoint was safety (adverse events [AEs]) within 6 hours; cardiac arrest or death within 24 hours postinfusion). Secondary endpoints included patient survival at 31 days after the first infusion and time to recovery. No difference was observed between groups in infusion-associated AEs. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed related to UC-MSC infusions. UC-MSC infusions in COVID-19 ARDS were found to be safe. Inflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased in UC-MSC-treated subjects at day 6. Treatment was associated with significantly improved patient survival (91% vs 42%, P = .015), SAE-free survival (P = .008), and time to recovery (P = .03). UC-MSC infusions are safe and could be beneficial in treating subjects with COVID-19 ARDS.

Several treatments have been proposed, many of which have proven ineffective. Consequently, there is a need to review the published evidence of drug clinical trials to guide future prescribing. A systematic review of published clinical trials and retrospective observational studies was carried out. The search was made using PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. Articles published between January 2020 and October 2020 and written in the English language were retrieved and included in the study. Researches that used traditional medicine, in-vitro and in-vivo animal studies, as well as reviews were excluded. Seventy-three relevant articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were finally selected and reviewed. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and azithromycin produced no clinical evidence of efficacy in randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT). However, retrospective observational studies reported the efficacy of remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir in reducing viral load, although there have been concerns with lopinavir/ritonavir and, more recently, remdesivir. Recently, tocilizumab, dexamethasone, and methylprednisolone significantly relieved lung inflammation and decreased mortality in patients with severe COVID-19. In addition, convalescent plasma was effective in boosting strong immunity among patients with mild COVID-19. There is currently no single worldwide approved therapeutic option for patients with COVID-19 despite the initial hype with medicines, including hydroxychloroquine. Nonetheless, dexamethasone has shown promise in symptomatic treatment and convalescent plasma in boosting immunity. New treatments are currently being researched, and the findings will be reported accordingly to provide evidence-based guidance for prescribers and policymakers.	33402839	Infection and drug resistance	1178-6973	10.2147/IDR.S289037

In patients with severe COVID-19, we assessed the association between chronic ACEI/ARB use and the occurrence of kidney, lung, heart, and liver dysfunctions and the severity of the inflammatory reaction as evaluated by biomarkers kinetics, and their association with disease outcomes.                                                  Methods                   We performed a retrospective longitudinal cohort study on consecutive patients with newly diagnosed severe COVID-19. Independent predictors were assessed through receiver operating characteristic analysis, time-series analysis, logistic regression analysis, and multilevel modeling for repeated measures.                                                  Results                   On the 149 patients included in the study 30% (44/149) were treated with ACEI/ARB. ACEI/ARB use was independently associated with the following biochemical variations: phosphorus &amp;gt;40 mg/L (odds ratio [OR], 3.35, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.83–6.14), creatinine &amp;gt;10.1 mg/L (OR, 3.22, 2.28–4.54), and urea nitrogen (UN) &amp;gt;0.52 g/L (OR, 2.65, 95% CI, 1.89–3.73). ACEI/ARB use was independently associated with acute kidney injury stage ≥1 (OR, 3.28, 95% CI, 2.17–4.94). The daily dose of ACEI/ARB was independently associated with altered kidney markers with an increased risk of +25 to +31% per each 10 mg increment of lisinopril-dose equivalent. In multivariable multilevel modeling, UN &amp;gt;0.52 g/L was independently associated with the risk of acute respiratory failure (OR, 3.54, 95% CI, 1.05–11.96).                                                  Conclusions                   Patients chronically treated with ACEI/ARB who have severe COVID-19 are at increased risk of acute kidney injury. In these patients, the increase in UN associated with ACEI/ARB use could predict the development of acute respiratory failure.

Such management should be applied in high-risk patients age > 50 years or with one or more medical problems including cardiovascular disease. We evaluated a total of 922 outpatients from March to September 2020. All patients underwent contemporary real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay tests from anterior nasal swab samples. Patients age 50.5 ± 13.7 years (range 12 to 89), 61.6% women, at moderate or high risk for COVID-19 received empiric management via telemedicine. At least two agents with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (zinc, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin) and one antibiotic (azithromycin, doxycycline, ceftriaxone) were used along with inhaled budesonide and/or intramuscular dexamethasone consistent with the emergent science on early COVID-19 treatment. For patients with high severity of symptoms, urgent in-clinic administration of albuterol nebulizer, inhaled budesonide, and intravenous volume expansion with supplemental parenteral thiamine 500 mg, magnesium sulfate 4 grams, folic acid 1 gram, vitamin B12 1 mg. A total of 320/922 (34.7%) were treated resulting in 6/320 (1.9%) and 1/320 (0.3%) patients that were hospitalized and died, respectively. We conclude that early ambulatory (not hospitalized, treated at home), multidrug therapy is safe, feasible, and associated with low rates of hospitalization and death. Early treatment should be considered for high-risk patients as an emergency measure while we await randomized trials and guidelines for ambulatory management.	33388006	Reviews in cardiovascular medicine	1530-6550	10.31083/j.rcm.2020.04.260

Effects of Tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients: a cohort study.	https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05701-4	22/12/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-020-05701-4	1471-2334	14712334	BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES (ONLINE)	A3	1.042	112	3.75	 Abstract                  Background                 Due to the lack of proven therapies, we evaluated the effects of early administration of tocilizumab for COVID-19. By inhibition of the IL-6 receptor, tocilizumab may help to mitigate the hyperinflammatory response associated with progressive respiratory failure from SARS-CoV-2.                                Methods                 A retrospective, observational study was conducted on hospitalized adults who received intravenous tocilizumab for COVID-19 between March 23, 2020 and April 10, 2020.                                Results                 Most patients were male (66.7%), Hispanic (63.3%) or Black (23.3%), with a median age of 54 years. Tocilizumab was administered at a median of 8 days (range 1–21) after initial symptoms and 2 days (range 0–12) after hospital admission. Within 30 days from receiving tocilizumab, 36 patients (60.0%) demonstrated clinical improvement, 9 (15.0%) died, 33 (55.0%) were discharged alive, and 18 (30.0%) remained hospitalized. Successful extubation occurred in 13 out of 29 patients (44.8%). Infectious complications occurred in 16 patients (26.7%) at a median of 10.5 days. After tocilizumab was administered, there was a slight increase in PaO 2/FiO 2 and an initial reduction in CRP, but this effect was not sustained beyond day 10.                                Conclusions                 Majority of patients demonstrated clinical improvement and were successfully discharged alive from the hospital after receiving tocilizumab. We observed a rebound effect with CRP, which may suggest the need for higher or subsequent doses to adequately manage cytokine storm. Based on our findings, we believe that tocilizumab may have a role in the early treatment of COVID-19, however larger randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm this.

During COVID-19 outbreak, several dermatological patients contracted SARS-CoV-2 experiencing only mild symptoms, but no protocol were approved. A multicenter prospective observational study that enrolled COVID-19 patients visited with teledermatology and undergoing TetraC was performed. About 38 adult outpatients (M/F: 20/18, age 42.6 years [21-67]) were enrolled. During the TetraC treatment, symptoms resolved in all patients within 10 days. Remarkably, ageusia and anosmia disappeared in the first week of TetraC treatment. TetraC seem a promising drug to treat COVID-19 outpatients with mild symptoms.	33354849	Dermatologic therapy	1529-8019	10.1111/dth.14694

Efficacy of early hydroxychloroquine treatment in preventing COVID-19 pneumonia aggravation, the experience from Shanghai	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33342929/	18/12/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	PUBMED_ID:33342929/	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Hidroxicloroquina']	['Hydroxychloroquine']	The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of multiple treatments, especially hydroxychloroquine, used in different disease stages of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). All consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (Shanghai, China) between January 20, 2020, and April 30, 2020, were enrolled, and their clinical data were retrospectively collected. Binary logistic regression was used to screen the factors associated with disease aggravation, and multivariable analyses with the Cox proportional hazards model were used to estimate the effects of prognostic factors on the improvement time and PCR conversion days in throat swabs and stool swabs. A total of 616 patients, including 50 (8.11%) severe and 18 (2.92%) critical patients, were enrolled in our retrospective cohort study. The early use of hydroxychloroquine was a protective factor associated with disease aggravation (95% CI: 0.040-0.575, p = 0.006). Clinical improvement by 20 days was significantly different between patients with hydroxychloroquine used early and those with hydroxychloroquine not used (p = 0.016, 95% CI: 1.052-1.647). The median time to clinical improvement was 6 days in the hydroxychloroquine used early group, compared with 9 days in the without hydroxychloroquine used group and 8 days in the with hydroxychloroquine not used early group (p < 0.001). Hydroxychloroquine used early was associated with earlier PCR conversion in both throat swabs (HR = 1.558, p = 0.001) and stool swabs (HR = 1.400, p = 0.028). The use of hydroxychloroquine at an early stage is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating patients before irreversible severe respiratory complications occur. The early use of hydroxychloroquine decreased the improvement time and the duration of COVID-19 detection in throat and stool swabs.	33342929	Bioscience trends	1881-7823	10.5582/bst.2020.03340

PRINT)	A1	3.218	185	8.76	 Abstract                  Background                 Corticoid therapy has been recommended in the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19, yet its efficacy is currently still under evaluation. We investigated the effect of corticosteroid treatment on 90-day mortality and SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance in severe patients with COVID-19.                                Methods                 294 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were recruited between December 30, 2019 and February 19, 2020. Logistic regression, Cox proportional-hazards model and marginal structural modeling (MSM) were applied to evaluate the associations between corticosteroid use and corresponding outcome variables.                                Results                 Out of the 294 critically ill patients affected by COVID-19, 183 (62.2%) received corticosteroids, with methylprednisolone as the most frequently administered corticosteroid (175 accounting for 96%). Of those treated with corticosteroids, 69.4% received corticosteroid prior to ICU admission. When adjustments and subgroup analysis were not performed, no significant associations between corticosteroids use and 90-day mortality or SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance were found. However, when stratified analysis based on corticosteroid initiation time was performed, there was a significant correlation between corticosteroid use (≤ 3 day after ICU admission) and 90-day mortality (logistic regression adjusted for baseline: OR 4.49, 95% CI 1.17–17.25,  p = 0.025; Cox adjusted for baseline and time varying variables: HR 3.89, 95% CI 1.94–7.82,  p &lt; 0.001; MSM adjusted for baseline and time-dependent variants: OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.16–4.65,  p = 0.017). No association was found between corticosteroid use and SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance even after stratification by initiation time of corticosteroids and adjustments for confounding factors (corticosteroids use ≤ 3 days initiation vs no corticosteroids use) using MSM were performed.                                Conclusions                 Early initiation of corticosteroid use (≤ 3 days after ICU admission) was associated with an increased 90-day mortality. Early use of methylprednisolone in the ICU is therefore not recommended in patients with severe COVID-19.

Although World Health Organization (WHO) has not recommended any effective treatments for COVID-19, there are some reports about use of antiviral drugs. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of Arbidol (ARB) on COVID-19 disease.                                Methods                 Using an open-label randomized controlled trial, we examined the efficacy of ARB in patients with COVID-19 in a teaching hospital. One hundred eligible patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 were recruited in the study and assigned randomly to two groups of either hydroxychloroquine followed by KALETRA (Lopinavir/ritonavir) or hydroxychloroquine followed by ARB. The primary outcome was hospitalization duration and clinical improvement 7 days after admission. The criteria of improvement were relief of cough, dyspnea, and fever. Time to relief from fever was also assessed across the two groups. Without any dropouts, 100 patients were entered into the study for the final analysis at significance level of 0.05.                                Results                 The mean age of patients was 56.6 (17.8) years and 56.2 (14.8) years in ARB and KALETRA groups, respectively. Majority of patients were male across two groups (66 and 54%). The duration of hospitalization in ARB group was significantly less than KALETRA arm (7.2 versus 9.6 days;  P = 0.02). Time to relief fever was almost similar across two groups (2.7 versus 3.1 days in ARB and KALETRA arms, respectively). Peripheral oxygen saturation rate was significantly different after 7 days of admission across two groups (94% versus 92% in ARB and KALETRA groups respectively) ( P = 0.02). Based on multiple linear regression analysis, IHD, Na level, and oxygen saturation at the time of admission and type of therapy were the independent adjusted variables that determined the duration of hospitalization in patients with COVID-19.                                Conclusion                 Our findings showed that Arbidol, compared to KALETRA, significantly contributes to clinical and laboratory improvements, including peripheral oxygen saturation, requiring ICU admissions, duration of hospitalization, chest CT involvements, WBC, and ESR. We suggest further studies on ARB against COVID-19 using larger sample size and multicenter design.

Impact of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors use on mortality in severe COVID-19 patients with hypertension: a retrospective observational study.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0300060520979151	15/12/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1177/0300060520979151	0300-0605	03000605	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL RESEARCH	B1	0.366	61	1.58	  Objective  Association of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) use with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains controversial. We aimed to investigate the impact of ACEI/ARB use on all-cause mortality in severe COVID-19 patients with hypertension.   Methods  We enrolled 650 COVID-19 patients from Changsha and Wuhan city between 17 January 2020 and 8 March 2020. Demographic, clinical characteristics, and outcomes were collected. Multivariable analysis and propensity-score matching were performed to assess the impact of ACEI/ARB therapy on mortality.   Results  Among the 650 patients, 126 who had severe COVID-19 concomitant with hypertension were analyzed. The average age was 66 years and 56 (44.4%) were men. There were 37 ACEI/ARB users and 21 in-hospital deaths (mortality rate, 16.7%). Male sex (odds ratio [OR], 5.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.75 to 17.8), but not ACEI/ARB use (OR, 1.09; 95%CI, 0.31 to 3.43), was an independent risk factor for mortality in severe COVID-19 patients with hypertension. After propensity-score matching, 60 severe COVID-19 patients were included and no significant correlation between use of ACEI/ARB and mortality was observed.   Conclusions  There was no significant association of ACEI/ARB use with mortality in severe COVID-19 patients with hypertension. These findings support the continuation of ACEI/ARB therapy for such patients.

Corticosteroid use in COVID‑19 patients: a systematic review and meta‑analysis on clinical outcomes.	https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-020-03400-9	14/12/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-020-03400-9	1364-8535	13648535	CRITICAL CARE (LONDON. PRINT)	A1	3.218	185	8.76	 Abstract                  Background                 In the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been worldwide debate on the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19. In the recent RECOVERY trial, evaluating the effect of dexamethasone, a reduced 28-day mortality in patients requiring oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation was shown. Their results have led to considering amendments in guidelines or actually already recommending corticosteroids in COVID-19. However, the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids still remain uncertain, and reliable data to further shed light on the benefit and harm are needed.                                Objectives                 The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids in COVID-19.                                Methods                 A systematic literature search of RCTS and observational studies on adult patients was performed across Medline/PubMed, Embase and Web of Science from December 1, 2019, until October 1, 2020, according to the PRISMA guidelines. Primary outcomes were short-term mortality and viral clearance (based on RT-PCR in respiratory specimens). Secondary outcomes were: need for mechanical ventilation, need for other oxygen therapy, length of hospital stay and secondary infections.                                Results                 Forty-four studies were included, covering 20.197 patients. In twenty-two studies, the effect of corticosteroid use on mortality was quantified. The overall pooled estimate (observational studies and RCTs) showed a significant reduced mortality in the corticosteroid group (OR 0.72 (95%CI 0.57–0.87). Furthermore, viral clearance time ranged from 10 to 29 days in the corticosteroid group and from 8 to 24 days in the standard of care group. Fourteen studies reported a positive effect of corticosteroids on need for and duration of mechanical ventilation. A trend toward more infections and antibiotic use was present.                                Conclusions                 Our findings from both observational studies and RCTs confirm a beneficial effect of corticosteroids on short-term mortality and a reduction in need for mechanical ventilation. And although data in the studies were too sparse to draw any firm conclusions, there might be a signal of delayed viral clearance and an increase in secondary infections.

Therapeutic dosing of low-molecular-weight heparin may decrease mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 infection.	https://www.annsaudimed.net/doi/pdf/10.5144/0256-4947.2020.462	03/12/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.5144/0256-4947.2020.462	0256-4947	02564947	Annals of Saudi Medicine	-	0.354	48	1.57	 ABSTRACT                        BACKGROUND:             Venous thromboembolism or extensive thrombosis is relatively common in patients with severe COVID-19 infection and has been associated with increased mortality. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, several prophylactic doses and types of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) are being used worldwide; however, there are no high-quality studies or recommendations for an optimal prophylactic LMWH dose.                                  OBJECTIVES:             Investigate the relationship between coagulation parameters and the LMWH dose, and mortality and ICU admission in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.                                  DESIGN:             Retrospective.                                  SETTING:             Tertiary care hospital.                                  PATIENTS AND METHODS:             Data on clinical features, coagulation parameters and anticoagulant medications of inpatients with severe COVID-19 were collected for the period between 11 March 2020 and 31 April 2020.                                  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:             Mortality and ICU admission for prophylactic dose LMWH (0.5 mg/kg twice daily) and therapeutic dose LMWH (1 mg/kg twice daily).                                  SAMPLE SIZE:             154 cases.                                  RESULTS:                           Ninety-eight (63.6%) patients were treated with the LMWH prophylactic dose and 56 (36.4%) patients were treated with the therapeutic dose. Forty-four (44.9%) of 98 patients using the prophylactic dose LMWH died, while 10 (17.9%) of 56 patients using the therapeutic dose LMWH died (               P              =.001). Mortality was 6.4-fold higher in the prophylactic dose LMWH users than in the therapeutic dose LMWH users (OR=6.5, 95% CI: 2.4–17.6,               P              &lt;.001).                                              CONCLUSIONS:             Therapeutic dosing of LMWH may decrease mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 infected pneumonia. More aggressive thromboprophylaxis regimens using higher doses of heparin should be evaluated in prospective studies.                                  LIMITATIONS:             Lack of information about bleeding complications. LMWH was not compared with other anticoagulant therapies. There was no comparison between our two groups on the APACHE score. Used different doses of LMWH in different clinics in our hospital.

In this multicenter retrospective study, we identified 2190 adult patients admitted for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in three participating centers. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted in patients with comorbid hypertension to examine the potential association between clinical outcomes, disease severity, and clinical characteristics with the use of ACEI, ARB, calcium-channel blockers (CCB), beta-blockers (BB), and thiazide diuretics. The clinical outcome, dyspnea, and fatigue were significantly improved in patients, especially elderly patients who were older than 65 years, who took ARB drugs prior to hospitalization compared to patients who took no drugs. The reduction of disease severity of elderly COVID-19 patients was associated with CCB and ACEI users. Clinical indices, including CRP, lymphocyte count, procalcitonin D dimer, and hemoglobin, were significantly improved in elderly ARB users. In addition, the clinical outcomes were statistically significantly improved in patients who took antihypertension drugs ARB, BB, and CCB after statistical adjustment by all ages, gender, baseline of blood pressures, and coexisting medical conditions. Our data indicate that hypertension drugs ARB, ACEI, CCB, and BB might be beneficial for COVID-19 patients.	33298897	Cell discovery	2056-5968	10.1038/s41421-020-00221-6

The Role of Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 Treatment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.	https://doi.org/10.47102/annals-acadmed.sg.2020370	31/10/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.47102/annals-acadmed.sg.2020370	0304-4602	03044602	Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore	-	0.514	64	2.23	 Objective: A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to examine the role of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: We performed a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane- Library, Web of Science, Google-Scholar, and medRxiv pre-print databases using available MeSH terms for COVID-19 and hydroxychloroquine. Data from all studies that focused on the effectiveness of HCQ with or without the addition of azithromycin (AZM) in confirmed COVID-19 patients, which were published up to 12 September 2020, were collated for analysis using CMA v.2.2.064. Results: Our systematic review retrieved 41 studies. Among these, 37 studies including 45,913 participants fulfilled the criteria for subsequent meta-analysis. The data showed no significant difference in treatment efficacy between the HCQ and control groups (RR: 1.02, 95% CI, 0.81–1.27). Combination of HCQ with AZM also did not lead to improved treatment outcomes (RR: 1.26, 95% CI, 0.91–1.74). Furthermore, the mortality difference was not significant, neither in HCQ treatment group (RR: 0.86, 95% CI, 0.71–1.03) nor in HCQ+AZM treatment group (RR: 1.28, 95% CI, 0.76–2.14) in comparison to controls. Meta-regression analysis showed that age was the factor that significantly affected mortality (P&lt;0.00001). Conclusion: The meta-analysis found that there was no clinical benefit of using either HCQ by itself or in combination with AZM for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Hence, it may be prudent for clinicians and researchers to focus on other therapeutic options that may show greater promise in this disease.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of effectiveness and safety of favipiravir in the management of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) patients.	https://www.ijp-online.com/text.asp?2020/52/5/414/302510	05/12/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://www.ijp-online.com/text.asp?2020/52/5/414/302510	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Favipiravir']	['Favipiravir']	Multiple options are being tried for the management of 2019-nCoV infection since its pandemic started. Favipiravir (FPV) is one of drugs, which is also being tried for the management of 2019-nCoV infection. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FPV in published literature. Comparative randomized or nonrandomized controlled clinical trials comparing FPV to the standard of care (SOC)/control or other antiviral agent/combinations were included. A total of 12 databases were searched and identify four studies which were further used for final analysis. The data analysis was done as pooled prevalence using a random effect model by "RevMan manager version 5.4.1 and "R" software. The point estimate, odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for dichotomous data. In the present study, the marginal beneficial effect was seen in the FPV group in overall clinical improvement comparison to SOC/control, i.e., (4 studies, log OR [95% CI] (-0.19 [-0.51, 0.13]). However, in all other outcomes, it was found to be comparable to the SOC/control arm namely "clinical improvement on day 7-10" (3 studies, OR [95% CI] 1.63 [1.07, 2.48]) while "clinical improvement on day 10-14" (3 studies, OR [95% CI] 1.37 [0.24, 7.82]) and viral negativity was seen (4 studies, OR [95% CI] 1.91 [0.91, 4.01]). No difference in efficacy was found between FPV versus lopinavir/ritonavir or arbidol groups. Regarding adverse effects, except for the occurrence of rash (higher in the FPV group), safety was comparable to SOC. In our study, there was a marginal difference between the FPV and the SOC arm in terms of "clinical improvement" on day 7-10 or 10-14, and "virological negativity" on day 10-14." However, some benefit was observed in a few studies, but it was also comparable to the control drugs or SOC.	33283773	Indian journal of pharmacology	1998-3751	10.4103/ijp.ijp_998_20

Vitamin D (in its "parent" form, cholecalciferol) has been proposed in the pharmacological management of COVID-19 by various sources. We aimed to determine whether COVID-19 mortality was affected by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, vitamin D status, or cholecalciferol therapy, and to elucidate any other predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were opportunistically recruited from three UK hospitals, and their data were collected retrospectively. Logistic regression was used to determine any relationships between COVID-19 mortality and potential predictors, including 25(OH)D levels and cholecalciferol booster therapy. A total of 986 participants with COVID-19 were studied, of whom 151 (16.0%) received cholecalciferol booster therapy. In the primary cohort of 444 patients, cholecalciferol booster therapy was associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality, following adjustment for potential confounders (OR	33322317	Nutrients	2072-6643	10.3390/nu12123799

PRINT)	A1	3.218	185	8.76	 Abstract                  Background                 A subset of critically ill COVID-19 patients develop a hyperinflammatory state. Anakinra, a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, is known to be effective in several hyperinflammatory diseases. We investigated the effects of anakinra on inflammatory parameters and clinical outcomes in critically ill, mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with clinical features of hyperinflammation.                                Methods                 In this prospective cohort study, 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with anakinra were compared to a group of standard care. Serial data of clinical inflammatory parameters and concentrations of multiple circulating cytokines were determined and aligned on start day of anakinra in the treatment group, and median start day of anakinra in the control group. Analysis was performed for day − 10 to + 10 relative to alignment day. Clinical outcomes were analyzed during 28 days. Additionally, three sensitivity analyses were performed: (1) using propensity score-matched groups, (2) selecting patients who did not receive corticosteroids, and (3) using a subset of the control group aimed to match the criteria (fever, elevated ferritin) for starting anakinra treatment.                                Results                 Baseline patient characteristics and clinical parameters on ICU admission were similar between groups. As a consequence of bias by indication, plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) ( p = 0.0002), ferritin ( p = 0.009), and temperature ( p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the anakinra group on alignment day. Following treatment, no relevant differences in kinetics of circulating cytokines were observed between both groups. Decreases of clinical parameters, including temperature ( p = 0.03), white blood cell counts ( p = 0.02), and plasma levels of ferritin ( p = 0.003), procalcitonin ( p = 0.001), creatinine ( p = 0.01), and bilirubin ( p = 0.007), were more pronounced in the anakinra group. No differences in duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU length of stay were observed between groups. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these results.                                Conclusions                 Anakinra is effective in reducing clinical signs of hyperinflammation in critically ill COVID-19 patients. A randomized controlled trial is warranted to draw conclusion about the effects of anakinra on clinical outcomes.              	['Anakinra', 'Anakinra']	['Anakinra', 'Anakinra']	-	-	-	-	-

Pentoxifylline decreases serum LDH levels and increases lymphocyte count in COVID-19 patients: Results from an external pilot study.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576920336766?via%3Dihub	26/11/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576920336766?via%3Dihub	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Pentoxifilina']	['Pentoxifylline']	We have previously hypothesized that pentoxifylline could be beneficial for the treatment of COVID-19 given its potential to restore the immune response equilibrium, reduce the impact of the disease on the endothelium and alveolar epithelial cells, and improve the circulatory function.Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and lymphocyte count are accessible biomarkers that correlate with the severity of COVID-19, the need for hospitalization, and mortality, reflecting the host immune response's contribution to the seriousness of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We carried out this external pilot study on 38 patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 to test the effect pentoxifylline on parameters such as LDH, lymphocyte count, days of hospitalization, mortality, and proportion of patients requiring intubation. Twenty-six patients were randomized to receive 400 mg of pentoxifylline t.i.d. plus standard therapy (pentoxifylline group), while the rest received the standard treatment (control group). Linear regression models were built for statistically significant parameters. Pentoxifylline treatment was associated with a 64.25% increase (CI95% 11.83, 116.68) in lymphocyte count and a 29.61% decrease (CI95% 15.11, 44.10) in serum LDH. Although a trend towards reduced days of hospitalization, mortality, and proportion of patients requiring intubation was observed, no statistically significant difference was found for these parameters. Our findings open the possibility of pentoxifylline being repositioned as a drug for COVID-19 treatment with the advantages of a proven safety profile, availability, and no risk of immunosuppression; however, this evidence needs to be confirmed in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial.	33278747	International immunopharmacology	1878-1705	10.1016/j.intimp.2020.107209

A systematic review of corticosteroid treatment for noncritically ill patients with COVID‑19.	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78054-2	01/12/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78054-2	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Corticosteroides']	['Corticosteroids']	The World Health Organization (WHO) has published guidance recommending systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with severe or critical COVID-19 and no corticosteroids for those with nonsevere COVID-19. Although their recommendations for critical cases were based on the results from seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs), those for noncritical cases were based on the results from only one RCT, the Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial. In search of additional evidence of corticosteroids' effect on COVID-19, we systematically reviewed controlled observational studies, besides RCTs, that assessed the impact of corticosteroid treatment on any type of mortality and/or other outcomes in noncritical patients. Of the 4037 titles and abstracts screened, we ultimately included the RECOVERY trial and five controlled observational studies using propensity score matching, (accessed on September 8, 2020). Two of the controlled observational studies assessed the association between corticosteroid treatment and in-hospital mortality, without finding statistical significance. Four of the controlled observational studies assessed corticosteroids' effect on other outcomes, demonstrating that they were associated with reduced risk of intubation in patients requiring oxygen and with longer hospitalization and viral shedding in mild or moderate cases. These results support the WHO recommendations not to use corticosteroids for nonsevere COVID-19.	33262415	Scientific reports	2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-020-78054-2

The aim of our study was to evaluate HCQ concentrations in the lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF) in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the virus that causes COVID-19. This was a retrospective, observational, multicentre, pharmacokinetic study of HCQ in critically ill COVID-19 patients. No additional interventions or additional samples compared with standard care of these patients were conducted in our teaching hospital. We included all intubated COVID-19 patients treated with crushed HCQ tablets, regardless of the dosage administered by nasogastric tube. Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples (n = 28) were collected from 22 COVID-19 patients and total HCQ concentrations in ELF were estimated. Median (interquartile range) HCQ plasma concentrations were 0.09 (0.06-0.14) mg/L and 0.07 (0.05-0.08) mg/L for 400 mg × 1/day and 200 mg × 3/day, respectively. Median HCQ ELF concentrations were 3.74 (1.10-7.26) mg/L and 1.81 (1.20-7.25) for 400 mg × 1/day and 200 mg × 3/day, respectively. The median ratio of ELF/plasma concentrations was 40.0 (7.3-162.7) and 21.2 (18.4-109.5) for 400 mg × 1/day and 200 mg × 3/day, respectively. ELF exposure is likely to be underestimated from HCQ concentrations in plasma. In clinical practice, low plasma concentrations should not induce an increase in drug dosage because lung exposure may already be high.	33259916	International journal of antimicrobial agents	1872-7913	10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106247
A Retrospective Study on the Effects of Convalescent Plasma Therapy in 24 Patients Diagnosed with COVID-19 Pneumonia in February and March 2020 at 2 Centers in Wuhan, China.	https://www.medscimonit.com/abstract/index/idArt/928755	02/12/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://www.medscimonit.com/abstract/index/idArt/928755	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Plasma convalescente']	['Convalescent Plasma']	BACKGROUND This retrospective study aimed to describe the effects of convalescent plasma therapy in 24 patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during February and March 2020 in Wuhan, China. MATERIAL AND METHODS The confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was made by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data and laboratory test reports of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who received a convalescent plasma transfusion. RESULTS A total of 24 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were transfused with ABO-compatible convalescent plasma were enrolled in the study. Convalescent plasma transfusion showed an effective clinical outcome in 14 of 24 patients (an effective rate of 58.3%). No patients had an adverse reaction to the transfusion. Compared with before convalescent plasma transfusion, the lymphocyte count after convalescent plasma transfusion increased to a normal level (median: 0.80×10⁹/L vs. 1.12×10⁹/L, P=0.004). Other laboratory indicators such as white blood cells, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate transaminase showed a decreasing trend after transfusion. CONCLUSIONS This retrospective observational clinical study showed that convalescent plasma therapy could have beneficial effects on patient outcomes. Recently, regulatory authorization has been given for the use of convalescent plasma therapy, and clinical guidelines have been developed for the collection and use of convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin in patients with COVID-19.	33264276	Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research	1643-3750	10.12659/MSM.928755

The objective of this study was to analyze the seroprevalence and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 among users of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), disoproxil fumarate/FTC (TDF/FTC), or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/FTC and to compare it to that of a control group.                                                  Methods                   An observational descriptive study of the seroprevalence of antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 among men who have sex with men and transgender women without use of PrEP (Group 1; n = 250) and PrEP users with TDF/FTC (n = 409) or TAF/FTC (n = 91) (Group 2; n = 500) was conducted from May11, 2020 to June 27, 2020. All participants were provided with a structured questionnaire that collected information on the variables to be analyzed, and testing for immunoglobulin G antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay) was then carried out.                                                  Results                   The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 9.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.9–13.5) in the group without PrEP and 15.0% (95% CI, 12.0–18.4) in the group with PrEP (P = .026). Among users of TDF/FTC it was 14.7% (95% CI, 11.4–18.5), and in users of TAF/FTC it was 16.5% (95% CI, 9.5–25.7) (P = .661). In those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and receiving PrEP, 57.4% manifested symptoms, compared with 78.3% in the control group (P = .070). In users of TDF/FTC the figure was 53.3% and in users of TAF/FTC the figure was 73.3% (P = .100). The duration of symptoms was 11.5 days in the control group, 9.0 days in PrEP users (P = .116), 7.0 days in users of TDF/FTC, and 13.0 days in users of TAF/FTC (P = .100).                                                  Conclusions                   Users of PrEP, TDF/FTC, or TAF/FTC presented a higher seroprevalence to SARS-CoV-2 than the control group. No statistically significant differences were found in relation to clinical manifestations. The PrEP users should use the same prevention measures as those indicated for the general population.

A five day course of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 may reduce the duration of illness.	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.11.191	02/12/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1016/j.ijid.2020.11.191	1201-9712	12019712	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES	A3	2.433	104	9.39	-	['Ivermectina', 'Ivermectina']	['Ivermectin', 'Ivermectin']	Ivermectin, a US Food and Drug Administration-approved anti-parasitic agent, was found to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication in vitro. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to determine the rapidity of viral clearance and safety of ivermectin among adult SARS-CoV-2 patients. The trial included 72 hospitalized patients in Dhaka, Bangladesh, who were assigned to one of three groups: oral ivermectin alone (12 mg once daily for 5 days), oral ivermectin in combination with doxycycline (12 mg ivermectin single dose and 200 mg doxycycline on day 1, followed by 100 mg every 12 h for the next 4 days), and a placebo control group. Clinical symptoms of fever, cough, and sore throat were comparable among the three groups. Virological clearance was earlier in the 5-day ivermectin treatment arm when compared to the placebo group (9.7 days vs 12.7 days; p = 0.02), but this was not the case for the ivermectin + doxycycline arm (11.5 days; p = 0.27). There were no severe adverse drug events recorded in the study. A 5-day course of ivermectin was found to be safe and effective in treating adult patients with mild COVID-19. Larger trials will be needed to confirm these preliminary findings.	33278625	International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases	1878-3511	10.1016/j.ijid.2020.11.191

Although schistosomiasis and other neglected tropical diseases have been proposed to influence susceptibility to COVID-19, no study has looked into this. This study therefore investigated the impact of schistosomiasis on the transmission of COVID-19 and also evaluated the role of praziquantel treatment coverage on COVID-19 outcomes in African countries. The schistosomiasis endemicity and the preventive chemotherapy coverage index statuses were obtained from the World Health Organization databank. COVID-19 data were obtained from the Worldometer COVID-19 report. The data were adjusted and the percentage of COVID-19 cases confirmed, and active cases, recovery and deaths were computed. The COVID-19 outcomes were evaluated relative to schistosomiasis endemicity and treatment coverage. COVID-19 outcomes, especially active cases and recovery rates, were significantly improved in schistosomiasis nonendemic African countries (p < 0.05). While COVID-19 confirmed cases were significantly higher in countries with >75% schistosomiasis preventive chemotherapy coverage index (p < 0.05), improved COVID-19 outcomes were observed relative to active cases and recovery in countries with >75% preventive chemotherapy coverage index (p > 0.05). Schistosomiasis endemicity may be associated with negative COVID-19 outcomes, and higher praziquantel treatment coverage could reduce COVID-19 active cases and improve the recovery rate.	33251016	New microbes and new infections	2052-2975	10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100821
A COVID-19 Prophylaxis? Lower incidence associated with prophylactic administration of Ivermectin.	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106248	28/11/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106248	0924-8579	09248579	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS (PRINT)	A1	2.121	137	10.76	-	['Ivermectina']	['Ivermectin']	As COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) continues to rapidly spread throughout the world, the incidence varies greatly among different countries. These differences raise the question whether nations with a lower incidence share any medical commonalities that could be used not only to explain that lower incidence but also to provide guidance for potential treatments elsewhere. Such a treatment would be particularly valuable if it could be used as a prophylactic against SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) transmission, thereby effectively slowing the spread of the disease while we await the wide availability of safe and effective vaccines. Here, we show that countries with routine mass drug administration of prophylactic chemotherapy including ivermectin have a significantly lower incidence of COVID-19. Prophylactic use of ivermectin against parasitic infections is most common in Africa and we hence show that the reported correlation is highly significant both when compared among African nations as well as in a worldwide context. We surmise that this may be connected to ivermectin's ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, which likely leads to lower infection rates. However, other pathways must exist to explain the persistence of such an inhibitory effect after serum levels of ivermectin have declined. It is suggested that ivermectin be evaluated for potential off-label prophylactic use in certain cases to help bridge the time until a safe and effective vaccine becomes available.	33259913	International journal of antimicrobial agents	1872-7913	10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106248

Mortality reduction in 46 patients with severe COVID-19 treated with hyperimmune plasma. A proof-of-concept, single-arm, multicenter trial.	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32703797/	23/07/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	PUBMED_ID:32703797/	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Plasma convalescente']	['Convalescent Plasma']	Hyperimmune plasma from Covid-19 convalescent is a potential treatment for severe Covid-19. We conducted a multicenter one arm proof of concept interventional study. Patients with Covid-19 disease with moderate-to-severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, elevated C-reactive Protein and need for mechanical ventilation and/or CPAP were enrolled. One to three 250-300 ml unit of hyperimmune plasma (neutralizing antibodies titer ≥1:160) were administered. Primary outcome was 7-days hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were PaO2/FiO2, laboratory and radiologic changes, as well as weaning from mechanical ventilation and safety. The study observed 46 patients from March, 25 to April, 21 2020. Patients were aged 63, 61% male, of them, 30 were on CPAP and 7 intubated. PaO2/FiO2 was 128 (SD 47). Bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray was present in 36 patients (84%). Symptoms and ARDS duration were 14 (SD 7) and 6 days (SD 3). Three patients (6.5%) died within 7 days as compared to an expected 15% from the National Statistics and 30% from a small concurrent cohort of 23 patients. The upper one-sided 90%CI was 13.9%, allowing to reject the null hypothesis of a 15% mortality. PaO2/FiO2 increased by 112 units (95%CI 82 to142) in survivors, the chest radiogram severity decreased in 23% (95%CI 5% to 42%); CRP, Ferritin and LDH decreased by 60, 36 and 20% respectively. Weaning from CPAP was obtained in 26/30 patients and 3/7 were extubated. Five serious adverse events occurred in 4 patients (2 likely, 2 possible treatment related). In conclusion, Hyperimmune plasma in Covid-19 shows promising benefits, to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial. This proof of concept study could open to future developments including hyperimmune plasma banking, development of standardized pharmaceutical products and monoclonal antibodies.	33256382	Haematologica	1592-8721	10.3324/haematol.2020.261784
Renin-angiotensin system antagonists are associated with lower mortality in hypertensive patients with COVID-19.	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0036933020949219	17/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1177/0036933020949219	0036-9330	00369330	Scottish Medical Journal	-	0.293	27	1.26	  The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has been controversial. We performed a meta-analysis of all published studies that reported the outcomes of ACEIs/ARBs in patients with COVID-19. We included four observational studies (3,267 patients). The use of ACEIs/ARBs was associated with a similar risk of all-cause death (OR: 0.75, 95% CI [0.36, 1.57], p = 0.45). Sensitivity analysis including only hypertensive patients demonstrated a lower risk of death with ACEIs/ARBs use (OR: 0.57, 95% CI [0.32-0.98], p = 0.04). In conclusion, hypertensive patients with COVID-19 treated with ACEIs/ARBS have a lower mortality but further research is needed.

Soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products and Its Forms in COVID-19 Patients with and without Diabetes Mellitus: A Pilot Study on Their Role as Disease Biomarkers.	https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/11/3785	23/11/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/11/3785	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Receptor para os produtos finais de glicação avançada (RAGE)']	['Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)']	The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a well-known player of diabetes mellitus (DM)-related morbidities, was supposed to be involved in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), but no data exist about COVID-19, DM, and the soluble RAGE (sRAGE) forms. We quantified total sRAGE and its forms, the endogenously secretory esRAGE and the membrane-cleaved cRAGE, in COVID-19 patients with and without DM and in healthy individuals to explore how COVID-19 may affect these molecules and their potential role as biomarkers. Circulating sRAGE and esRAGE were quantified by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assays. cRAGE was obtained by subtracting esRAGE from total sRAGE. sRAGE, esRAGE, cRAGE, and the cRAGE/esRAGE ratio did not differ between DM and non-DM patients and had the same trend when compared to healthy individuals. Levels of total sRAGE, cRAGE, and cRAGE/esRAGE ratio were upregulated, while esRAGE was downregulated. The lack of difference between DM and non-DM COVID-19 patients in the levels of sRAGE and its forms supports the hypothesis that in COVID-19 the RAGE system is modulated regardless of glycemic control. Identifying how sRAGE and its forms associate to COVID-19 prognosis and the potential of RAGE as a therapeutic target to control inflammatory burden seem of relevance to help treatment of COVID-19.	33238596	Journal of clinical medicine	2077-0383	10.3390/jcm9113785

The aim of current study was evaluating the effects of early anticoagulant treatment in hospitalized Covid-19 patients.   Method  The present retrospective and comparative cohort study investigated 413 hospitalized Covid-19 patients treated with or without Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) (n = 187 and 226, respectively) in the Covid Clinics of Gulhane Education and Research Hospital in Ankara, Turkey, between March 18 and May 03, 2020. The treatment groups were consisted of the patients evaluated before and after The Covid-19 Treatment Guide update on April 12, 2020 that included the anticoagulant treatment thereafter.   Results  The mean age of all 413 patients (204 male and 209 female) at disease onset was 50.6 ± 16.7 years. The LMWH-treated patients had significantly higher coagulation markers such as d-dimer and platelet count than LMWH-untreated patients (p values &lt; 0.05). The inflammatory markers, ferritin, interleukin-6 and procalcitonin were significantly increased in LMWH-untreated patients (p values &lt; 0.05). The presence of any comorbidity was significantly more common in LMWH-treated patients compared to LMWH-untreated group (39.6% vs 19.9%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most frequent comorbidities in both groups. The number of intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and longer length of hospital stay were more commonly observed in LMWH-untreated patients (p values &lt;0.05).   Conclusions  Early anticoagulant treatment with relatively higher doses of LMWH may improve the clinical outcome of Covid-19 patients and shorten the length of hospital stay.

Do Zinc Supplements Enhance the Clinical Efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine?: a Randomized, Multicenter Trial	https://doi.org/10.1007/s12011-020-02512-1	27/11/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1007/s12011-020-02512-1	0163-4984	01634984	BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RESEARCH	A3	0.649	88	4.18	-	['Hidroxicloroquina', 'Zinco']	['Hydroxychloroquine', 'Zinc']	No specific treatment for COVID-19 infection is available up till now, and there is a great urge for effective treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality during this pandemic. We aimed to evaluate the effect of combining chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ) and zinc in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This was a randomized clinical trial conducted at three major University hospitals in Egypt. One hundred ninety-one patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection were randomized into two groups: group I (96) patients received both HCQ and zinc, and group II (95) received HCQ only. The primary endpoints were the recovery within 28 days, the need for mechanical ventilation, and death. The two groups were matched for age and gender. They had no significant difference regarding any of the baseline laboratory parameters or clinical severity grading. Clinical recovery after 28 days was achieved by 79.2% in the zinc group and 77.9% in zinc-free treatment group, without any significant difference (p = 0.969). The need for mechanical ventilation and the overall mortality rates did not show any significant difference between the 2 groups either (p = 0.537 and 0.986, respectively). The age of the patient and the need for mechanical ventilation were the only risk factors associated with the patients' mortality by the univariate regression analysis (p = 0.001 and < 0.001, respectively). Zinc supplements did not enhance the clinical efficacy of HCQ. More randomized studies are needed to evaluate the value of adding zinc to other therapies for COVID 19.

Safety and Efficacy of Apixaban For Therapeutic Anticoagulation in Critically Ill ICU Patients with Severe COVID-19 Respiratory Disease.	https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1720962	23/11/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1055/s-0040-1720962	2512-9465	25129465	-	-	-	-	-	 Abstract           Introduction Despite the use of unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), rates of thromboembolic disease, and subsequent morbidity and mortality remain unacceptably high in patients with severe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as apixaban, have numerous purported benefits although the safety and efficacy of their use in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with severe COVID-19 has yet to be evaluated.           Materials and Methods Single-center, retrospective cohort study of 21 ICU patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory disease treated with apixaban for atrial fibrillation (AFib), venous thromboembolism (VTE), catheter-induced thrombosis, and/or COVID-19-induced coagulopathy. The primary objective was to evaluate the incidence of bleeding events and secondary objectives included thromboembolic events, coagulation parameters, and mortality.           Results Ninety percent of patients were non-White, 43% were obese, 90% had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 76% required mechanical ventilation. Nearly half of (47.6%) also experienced renal dysfunction and required renal replacement therapy. Eighty-six percent of patients received prophylaxis or treatment with UFH or LMWH within the 24-hour period prior to apixaban initiation. Patients were initiated on apixaban for the treatment of suspected or confirmed VTE (67%) or AFib (33%). All coagulation parameters remained abnormal but stable throughout the 10-day monitoring period. No patients experienced any major bleeding events or thrombosis throughout the study period. There were four deaths during the follow-up period, all deemed unrelated to coagulopathy or bleeding.           Conclusion Apixaban appeared safe and efficacious in ICU patients with severe COVID-19 disease. These data encourage future trials seeking to optimize anticoagulation strategies in patients with severe COVID-19.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between recent exposure to ACEIs/ARBs and in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19.                                                  Methods                   We used data from a nationwide cohort of patients with COVID-19 from the health insurance claims data of South Korea, which were released for research purposes for public health by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of South Korea. Patients with COVID-19 were identified using the relevant diagnostic code. Propensity score matching (1:1) was carried out among patients with CVD according to the type of medication (ACEIs/ARBs vs other), and the risk of death was assessed.                                                  Results                   A total of 4936 patients with COVID-19 were analyzed, of whom 1048 (21.2%) had CVD. Of the 1048 patients with CVD, 864 (82.4%) received at least 1 antihypertensive medication before the diagnosis of COVID-19, including 359 (41.6%) who received ACEIs/ARBs and 505 (58.4%) who received drugs other than ACEIs/ARBs. Using the propensity scores for ACEI/ARB use, we matched 305 pairs of patients receiving ACEIs/ARBs and patients receiving other drugs. Recent use of ACEIs/ARBs was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in unadjusted analysis (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.33–1.14) or propensity score matching analysis (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.46–2.16).                                                  Conclusions                   In patients with COVID-19 and underlying CVDs, the recent use of ACEIs/ARBs was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. These findings do not support stopping or modifying ACEIs/ARBs in patients during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods                 An analysis of electronic health records for a large (68,466-case), international COVID-19 cohort, in 5-year age strata, revealed age-dependent sex differences. In particular, we surveyed the effects of systemic hormone administration in women. The primary outcome for estradiol therapy was death. Odds ratios (ORs) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were analyzed for 37,086 COVID-19 women in two age groups: pre- (15–49 years) and peri-/post-menopausal (&gt; 50 years).                                Results                 The incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is higher in women than men (by about + 15%) and, in contrast, the fatality rate is higher in men (about + 50%). Interestingly, the relationships between these quantities are linked to age: pre-adolescent girls and boys had the same risk of infection and fatality rate, while adult premenopausal women had a significantly higher risk of infection than men in the same 5-year age stratum (about 16,000 vs. 12,000 cases). This ratio changed again in peri- and postmenopausal women, with infection susceptibility converging with men. While fatality rates increased continuously with age for both sexes, at 50 years, there was a steeper increase for men. Thus far, these types of intricacies have been largely neglected. Because the hormone 17ß-estradiol influences expression of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, which plays a role in SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry, propensity score matching was performed for the women’s sub-cohort, comparing users vs. non-users of estradiol. This retrospective study of hormone therapy in female COVID-19 patients shows that the fatality risk for women &gt; 50 years receiving estradiol therapy (user group) is reduced by more than 50%; the OR was 0.33, 95% CI [0.18, 0.62] and the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.29, 95% CI [0.11,0.76]. For younger, pre-menopausal women (15–49 years), the risk of COVID-19 fatality is the same irrespective of estradiol treatment, probably because of higher endogenous estradiol levels.                                Conclusions                 As of this writing, still no effective drug treatment is available for COVID-19; since estradiol shows such a strong improvement regarding fatality in COVID-19, we suggest prospective studies on the potentially more broadly protective roles of this naturally occurring hormone.

To determine how these underlying disorders exacerbate pneumonia in COVID-19, we evaluated 79 patients with severe COVID-19 and grouped them according to whether or not they had comorbidities. Clinical information, laboratory examinations, immunological function, and treatment outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. Our study revealed that severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities had higher levels of inflammatory indices, including blood interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-6 and c-reactive protein levels as well as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. These were accompanied by lymphopenia, hypokalemia, hypoalbuminemia, a decrease in either CD4+ T cells or lymphocyte count, and coagulation disorders, which were closely related to poor prognosis. Patients with comorbidities also had longer disease remission times (27 ± 6.7 days) than those without comorbidities (20 ± 6.5 days). Cox multivariate analysis indicated that glucocorticoid therapy and IL-6 were independent prognostic factors. Our findings suggest that coexisting comorbidities aggravate COVID-19 through the excessive release of inflammatory factors and that glucocorticoid therapy may be beneficial.	33232277	Aging	1945-4589	10.18632/aging.202172

Hence, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the currently available data on the therapeutic potential of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID‐19 as add on therapy. A total of 629 patients were included in the 4 studies and all were COVID-19 RT-PCR positive. Among them, 397 patients received ivermectin along with usual therapy.

Anticoagulation in COVID-19: Effect of Enoxaparin, Heparin, and Apixaban on Mortality	https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1720978	13/11/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1055/s-0040-1720978	0340-6245	03406245	THROMBOSIS AND HAEMOSTASIS	A1	1.745	195	5.58	 Abstract           Background Mortality in coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with increases in prothrombotic parameters, particularly D-dimer levels. Anticoagulation has been proposed as therapy to decrease mortality, often adjusted for illness severity.           Objective We wanted to investigate whether anticoagulation improves survival in COVID-19 and if this improvement in survival is associated with disease severity.           Methods This is a cohort study simulating an intention-to-treat clinical trial, by analyzing the effect on mortality of anticoagulation therapy chosen in the first 48 hours of hospitalization. We analyzed 3,625 COVID-19+ inpatients, controlling for age, gender, glomerular filtration rate, oxygen saturation, ventilation requirement, intensive care unit admission, and time period, all determined during the first 48 hours.           Results Adjusted logistic regression analyses demonstrated a significant decrease in mortality with prophylactic use of apixaban (odds ratio [OR] 0.46, p = 0.001) and enoxaparin (OR = 0.49, p = 0.001). Therapeutic apixaban was also associated with decreased mortality (OR 0.57, p = 0.006) but was not more beneficial than prophylactic use when analyzed over the entire cohort or within D-dimer stratified categories. Higher D-dimer levels were associated with increased mortality (p &lt; 0.0001). When adjusted for these same comorbidities within D-dimer strata, patients with D-dimer levels &lt; 1 µg/mL did not appear to benefit from anticoagulation while patients with D-dimer levels &gt; 10 µg/mL derived the most benefit. There was no increase in transfusion requirement with any of the anticoagulants used.           Conclusion We conclude that COVID-19+ patients with moderate or severe illness benefit from anticoagulation and that apixaban has similar efficacy to enoxaparin in decreasing mortality in this disease.

METHODS  Sixty-two cases receiving favipiravir treatment for at least five days due to COVID-19 infection were evaluated retrospectively. Parameters including age, gender, nasopharyngeal swab positivity, and chronic diseases were analyzed. Hematologic parameters were analyzed before and after the treatment.  RESULTS  The mean age of the patients receiving treatment with favipiravir was 63.7±12.3 years. Nasopharyngeal swab positivity was detected in 67.7%. The most common comorbid conditions detected in patients were hypertension in 25 cases (40.3%) and diabetes in 16 cases (25.8%). In the statistical analysis of the hematological parameters before and after treatment with favipiravir, WBC, PT-PTT-INR levels were found to be unaffected; the mean RBC was found to have decreased from 4.33 ± 0.58 M/uL to 4.16 ± 0.54 M/uL (p:0.003); the median hemoglobin level was found to have decreased from 12.3 g/dl to 11.9 g/dl (p:0.041); the hematocrit level decreased from 38.1% ± 4.8 to 36.9% ± 4.2 (p:0.026); the median neutrophil count decreased from 4.57 K/uL to 3.85 K/uL (p:0.001); the mean lymphocyte count increased from 1.22 ± 0.53 K/uL to 1.84 ± 1.19 K/uL (p:0.000); and the mean platelet count increased from 244.1 ± 85.1 K/uL to 281.9 ± 103.3 K/uL (p:0.005).  CONCLUSION  We concluded that the pathological effect of treatment with favipiravir on the hematologic system was the suppression in the erythrocyte series, and there were no adverse effects in other hematologic parameters.

This retrospective cohort study was performed in all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in tertiary hospitals in Daegu, Korea. Patients were classified based on whether they received ACE-I or ARB before COVID-19 diagnosis. The analysis of the primary outcome, in-hospital mortality, was performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Of 130 patients with COVID-19, 30 (23.1%) who received ACE-I or ARB exhibited an increased risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10–4.38;  P = 0.025). ACE-I or ARB was also associated with severe complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.58; 95% CI, 1.02–6.51;  P = 0.045) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (aOR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.15–8.15;  P = 0.026).

BCG vaccination history associates with decreased SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence across a diverse cohort of healthcare workers.	https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI145157	19/11/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1172/JCI145157	0021-9738	00219738	THE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION	A1	5.527	505	14.12	-	['Vacina BCG']	['BCG vaccine']	BACKGROUNDSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 1 million deaths worldwide; thus, there is an urgent need to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies. The antituberculosis vaccine bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) demonstrates nonspecific, protective innate immune-boosting effects. Here, we determined whether a history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion in a longitudinal, retrospective observational study of a diverse cohort of health care workers (HCWs).METHODSWe assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and collected medical questionnaires, which included information on BCG vaccination status and preexisting demographic and clinical characteristics, from an observational cohort of HCWs in a multisite Los Angeles health care organization. We used multivariate analysis to determine whether a history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion.RESULTSOf the 6201 HCWs, 29.6% reported a history of BCG vaccination, whereas 68.9% had not received BCG vaccination. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG as well as the incidence of self-reported clinical symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were markedly decreased among HCWs with a history of BCG vaccination compared with those without BCG vaccination. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that a history of BCG vaccination, but not meningococcal, pneumococcal, or influenza vaccination, was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion.CONCLUSIONSA history of BCG vaccination was associated with a decrease in the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and a lower number of participants who self-reported experiencing COVID-19-related clinical symptoms in this cohort of HCWs. Therefore, large randomized, prospective clinical trials of BCG vaccination are urgently needed to confirm whether BCG vaccination can confer a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.	33211672	The Journal of clinical investigation	1558-8238	145157
Role of low-molecular weight heparin in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: a prospective observational study.	https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa563	19/11/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1093/ofid/ofaa563	2328-8957	23288957	OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES	A3	1.317	45	3.66	 Abstract  Background This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) on the outcome of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia.  Methods This is a prospective observational study including consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted to the University Hospital of Pisa (March 4–April 30, 2020). Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were collected. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. The secondary endpoint was a composite of death or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Low-molecular-weight heparin, hydroxychloroquine, doxycycline, macrolides, antiretrovirals, remdesivir, baricitinib, tocilizumab, and steroids were evaluated as treatment exposures of interest. First, a Cox regression analysis, in which treatments were introduced as time-dependent variables, was performed to evaluate the association of exposures and outcomes. Then, a time-dependent propensity score (PS) was calculated and a PS matching was performed for each treatment variable.  Results Among 315 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 70 (22.2%) died during hospital stay. The composite endpoint was achieved by 114 (36.2%) patients. Overall, 244 (77.5%) patients received LMWH, 238 (75.5%) received hydroxychloroquine, 201 (63.8%) received proteases inhibitors, 150 (47.6%) received doxycycline, 141 (44.8%) received steroids, 42 (13.3%) received macrolides, 40 (12.7%) received baricitinib, 13 (4.1%) received tocilizumab, and 13 (4.1%) received remdesivir. At multivariate analysis, LMWH was associated with a reduced risk of 30-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21–0.6; P &amp;lt; .001) and composite endpoint (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39–0.95; P = .029). The PS-matched cohort of 55 couples confirmed the same results for both primary and secondary endpoint.  Conclusions This study suggests that LMWH might reduce the risk of in-hospital mortality and severe ARDS in coronavirus disease 2019. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary findings.	['Heparina']	['Heparin']	-	-	-	-	-

An anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody (itolizumab) reduces circulating IL-6 in severe COVID-19 elderly patients.	https://doi.org/10.1186/s12979-020-00207-8	14/11/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1186/s12979-020-00207-8	1742-4933	17424933	IMMUNITY & AGEING	A2	1.697	50	7.3	 Abstract                  Background                 Since the COVID-19 outbreak an unprecedented challenge for healthcare systems around the world has been placed. In Cuba, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 11. Elderly with multiple comorbidities have been the most risky population. Although most patients present a mild to moderate disease, some have developed severe symptoms. One of the possible mechanisms underlying rapid disease progression is a cytokine storm, in which interleukin (IL) -6 seems to be a major mediator. Itolizumab is a humanized recombinant anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody (MAb), with the ability of reducing serum interferon gamma (INF-γ), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and IL-6. Based on these previous results in patients with psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, an expanded access clinical trial was approved by the Cuban regulatory agency for COVID-19 critically, severely and moderately ill patients.                                Results                 We show here a short kinetic of IL-6 serum concentration in the first 24 COVID-19 patients treated with itolizumab. Most of patients were elderly with multiple comorbidities. We found that with one itolizumab dose, the circulating IL-6 decreased in critically and severely ill patients, whereas in moderately ill patients the values didn’t rise as compared to their low baseline levels.                                Conclusion                 These findings suggest that itolizumab could be an attractive therapeutic option to decrease the negative outcome of the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients.

Remdesivir Use in Patients Requiring Mechanical Ventilation due to COVID-19.	https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa481	13/10/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1093/ofid/ofaa481	2328-8957	23288957	OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES	A3	1.317	45	3.66	 Abstract                                   Background                   Remdesivir has been associated with accelerated recovery of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, whether it is also beneficial in patients requiring mechanical ventilation is uncertain.                                                  Methods                   All consecutive intensive care unit (ICU) patients requiring mechanical ventilation due to COVID-19 were enrolled. Univariate and multivariable Cox models were used to explore the possible association between in-hospital death or hospital discharge, considered competing-risk events, and baseline or treatment-related factors, including the use of remdesivir. The rate of extubation and the number of ventilator-free days were also calculated and compared between treatment groups.                                                  Results                   One hundred thirteen patients requiring mechanical ventilation were observed for a median of 31 days of follow-up; 32% died, 69% were extubated, and 66% were discharged alive from the hospital. Among 33 treated with remdesivir (RDV), lower mortality (15.2% vs 38.8%) and higher rates of extubation (88% vs 60%), ventilator-free days (median [interquartile range], 11 [0–16] vs 5 [0–14.5]), and hospital discharge (85% vs 59%) were observed. Using multivariable analysis, RDV was significantly associated with hospital discharge (hazard ratio [HR], 2.25; 95% CI, 1.27–3.97; P = .005) and with a nonsignificantly lower mortality (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.26–2.1; P = .560). RDV was also independently associated with extubation (HR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.19–3.73; P = .011), which was considered a competing risk to death in the ICU in an additional survival model.                                                  Conclusions                   In our cohort of mechanically ventilated patients, RDV was not associated with a significant reduction of mortality, but it was consistently associated with shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and higher probability of hospital discharge, independent of other risk factors.

Of particular interest are chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The aims of this systematic review are to systematically identify and collate 24 studies describing the use of CQ and HCQ in human clinical trials and to provide a detailed synthesis of evidence of its efficacy and safety. Of clinical trials, 100% showed no significant difference in the probability of viral transmission or clearance in prophylaxis or therapy, respectively, compared to the control group. Among observational studies employing an endpoint specific to efficacy, 58% concurred with the finding of no significant difference in the attainment of outcomes. Three-fifths of clinical trials and half of observational studies examining an indicator unique to drug safety discovered a higher probability of adverse events in those treated patients suspected of, and diagnosed with, COVID-19. Of the total papers focusing on cardiac side-effects, 44% found a greater incidence of QTc prolongation and/or arrhythmias, 44% found no evidence of a significant difference, and 11% mixed results. The strongest available evidence points towards the inefficacy of CQ and HCQ in prophylaxis or in the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 patients.	33204210	Saudi pharmaceutical journal : SPJ : the official publication of the Saudi Pharmaceutical Society	1319-0164	10.1016/j.jsps.2020.11.003

Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, might improve outcomes by mitigating inflammation. We conducted a retrospective study of patients admitted to the University of Washington Hospital system with COVID-19 and requiring supplemental oxygen. Outcomes included clinical improvement, defined as a two-point reduction in severity on a six-point ordinal scale or discharge, and mortality within 28 days. We used Cox proportional-hazards models with propensity score inverse probability weighting to compare outcomes in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. We evaluated 43 patients who received tocilizumab and 45 who did not. Patients receiving tocilizumab were younger with fewer comorbidities but higher baseline oxygen requirements. Tocilizumab treatment was associated with reduced C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and temperature, but there were no meaningful differences in time to clinical improvement (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-2.22) or mortality (aHR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.21-1.52). A numerically higher proportion of tocilizumab-treated patients had subsequent infections, transaminitis, and cytopenias. Tocilizumab did not improve outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, this study was not powered to detect small differences, and there remains the possibility for a survival benefit.	33200828	Journal of medical virology	1096-9071	10.1002/jmv.26674

Mortality and other adverse outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus admitted for COVID-19 in association with glucose-lowering drugs: a nationwide cohort study.	https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01832-2	16/11/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1186/s12916-020-01832-2	1741-7015	17417015	BMC MEDICINE	A1	3.405	155	10.07	 Abstract  Background Limited evidence exists on the role of glucose-lowering drugs in patients with COVID-19. Our main objective was to examine the association between in-hospital death and each routine at-home glucose-lowering drug both individually and in combination with metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus admitted for COVID-19. We also evaluated their association with the composite outcome of the need for ICU admission, invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death as well as on the development of in-hospital complications and a long-time hospital stay.  Methods We selected all patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine’s registry of COVID-19 patients (SEMI-COVID-19 Registry). It is an ongoing, observational, multicenter, nationwide cohort of patients admitted for COVID-19 in Spain from March 1, 2020. Each glucose-lowering drug user was matched with a user of other glucose-lowering drugs in a 1:1 manner by propensity scores. In order to assess the adequacy of propensity score matching, we used the standardized mean difference found in patient characteristics after matching. There was considered to be a significant imbalance in the group if a standardized mean difference &gt; 10% was found. To evaluate the association between treatment and study outcomes, both conditional logit and mixed effect logistic regressions were used when the sample size was ≥ 100.  Results A total of 2666 patients were found in the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, 1297 on glucose-lowering drugs in monotherapy and 465 in combination with metformin. After propensity matching, 249 patients on metformin, 105 on dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, 129 on insulin, 127 on metformin/dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, 34 on metformin/sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, and 67 on metformin/insulin were selected. No at-home glucose-lowering drugs showed a significant association with in-hospital death; the composite outcome of the need of intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death; in-hospital complications; or long-time hospital stays.  Conclusions In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus admitted for COVID-19, at-home glucose-lowering drugs showed no significant association with mortality and adverse outcomes. Given the close relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 and the limited evidence on the role of glucose-lowering drugs, prospective studies are needed.

Elevated D-dimers and lack of anticoagulation predict PE in severe COVID-19 patients.	https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01811-2020	01/07/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1183/13993003.01811-2020	0903-1936	09031936	THE EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL	A1	4.336	255	9.39	  Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may predispose to venous thromboembolism. We determined factors independently associated with computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)-confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) in hospitalised severe COVID-19 patients.  Methods Among all (n=349) patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in a university hospital in a French region with a high rate of COVID-19, we analysed patients who underwent CTPA for clinical signs of severe disease (oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry ≤93% or breathing rate ≥30 breaths·min −1) or rapid clinical worsening. Multivariable analysis was performed using Firth penalised maximum likelihood estimates.  Results 162 (46.4%) patients underwent CTPA (mean± sd age 65.6±13.0 years; 67.3% male (95% CI 59.5–75.5%). PE was diagnosed in 44 (27.2%) patients. Most PEs were segmental and the rate of PE-related right ventricular dysfunction was 15.9%. By multivariable analysis, the only two significant predictors of CTPA-confirmed PE were D-dimer level and the lack of any anticoagulant therapy (OR 4.0 (95% CI 2.4–6.7) per additional quartile and OR 4.5 (95% CI 1.1–7.4), respectively). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified a D-dimer cut-off value of 2590 ng·mL −1 to best predict occurrence of PE (area under the curve 0.88, p&lt;0.001, sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 83.8%). D-dimer level &gt;2590 ng·mL −1 was associated with a 17-fold increase in the adjusted risk of PE.  Conclusion Elevated D-dimers (&gt;2590 ng·mL −1) and absence of anticoagulant therapy predict PE in hospitalised COVID-19 patients with clinical signs of severity. These data strengthen the evidence base in favour of systematic anticoagulation, and suggest wider use of D-dimer guided CTPA to screen for PE in acutely ill hospitalised patients with COVID-19.

A randomized clinical trial of the efficacy and safety of interferon β-1a in treatment of severe COVID-19.	https://doi.org/10.1128/AAC.01061-20	20/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1128/AAC.01061-20	0066-4804	00664804	Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy	-	1.546	269	5.16	 To the best of our knowledge, there is no published study on the use of interferon β-1a (IFN β-1a) in the treatment of severe COVID-19. In this randomized clinical trial, the efficacy and safety of IFN β-1a were evaluated in patients with severe COVID-19. Forty-two patients in the interferon group received IFN β-1a in addition to the national protocol medications (hydroxychloroquine plus lopinavir-ritonavir or atazanavir-ritonavir). Each 44-μg/ml (12 million IU/ml) dose of interferon β-1a was subcutaneously injected three times weekly for two consecutive weeks.

Since IL-6 plays a critical role in the inflammatory response, we assessed the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab (TCZ) in this single-centre, observational study in all Covid-19 in-patient with a proven SARS-CoV-2 rapidly progressing infection to prevent ALI and ARDS. 104 patients with COVID-19 treated with TCZ had a lower mortality rate (5·8%) compared with the regional mortality rate (11%), hospitalized patient's mortality (10%), and slightly lower than hospitalized patients treated with our standard of care alone (6%). We found that TCZ rapidly decreased acute phase reactants, ferritin and liver release of proteins. D-Dimer decreased slowly. We did not observe specific safety concerns. Early administration of IL6-R antagonists in COVID-19 patients with impending hyperinflammatory response, may be safe and effective treatment to prevent, ICU admission and further complications.	33189888	Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)	1521-7035	10.1016/j.clim.2020.108631

Methods                   In this randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial, healthy adults received a medium dose (MD) or a high dose (HD) of the vaccine at an interval of either 14 days or 28 days. Neutralizing antibody (NAb) and anti-S and anti-N antibodies were detected at different times, and adverse reactions were monitored for 28 days after full immunization.                                                  Results                   A total of 742 adults were enrolled in the immunogenicity and safety analysis. Among subjects in the 0, 14 procedure, the seroconversion rates of NAb in MD and HD groups were 89% and 96% with geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 23 and 30, respectively, at day 14 and 92% and 96% with GMTs of 19 and 21, respectively, at day 28 after immunization. Anti-S antibodies had GMTs of 1883 and 2370 in the MD group and 2295 and 2432 in the HD group. Anti-N antibodies had GMTs of 387 and 434 in the MD group and 342 and 380 in the HD group. Among subjects in the 0, 28 procedure, seroconversion rates for NAb at both doses were both 95% with GMTs of 19 at day 28 after immunization. Anti-S antibodies had GMTs of 937 and 929 for the MD and HD groups, and anti-N antibodies had GMTs of 570 and 494 for the MD and HD groups, respectively.

Recientemente, investigadores chinos y franceses reportaron la eficacia de la cloroquina y la hidroxicloroquina para inhibir la replicación in vitro del virus SARS-CoV-2. La diseminación oportuna de la información científica es clave en tiempos de pandemia. Es urgente contar con una revisión sistemática sobre el efecto y la seguridad de estos medicamentos en la COVID-19.Objetivo. Describir el estado actual de la literatura científica publicada hasta el 25 de marzo de 2020 sobre el uso de la cloroquina o sus derivados en el manejo de pacientes con COVID-19.Materiales y métodos. Se hizo una revisión sistemática exploratoria en PubMed, Embase, Lilacs y 15 bases de datos de la Plataforma de Registros Internacionales de Ensayos Clínicos de la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS). Se incluyeron publicaciones empíricas y teóricas en inglés, español, italiano, francés o portugués, y se hizo una síntesis narrativa de los resultados.Resultados. Se incluyeron 19 documentos y 24 registros de ensayos clínicos (n=43) de 18.059 pacientes. El 66 % (16/24) de los ensayos están registrados en China. Nueve ensayos evalúan la cloroquina exclusivamente y ocho, la hidroxicloroquina. Los documentos son comentarios (n=9), estudios in vitro (n=3), revisiones narrativas (n=2), guías de práctica clínica (n=2), así como una revisión sistemática, un consenso de expertos y un ensayo controlado.Conclusiones. Un ensayo clínico pequeño (n=26), no aleatorizado y defectuoso, respalda el uso de la hidroxicloroquina en pacientes con COVID-19. Se requiere de manera urgente tener acceso a los resultados de otros ensayos clínicos para determinar la efectividad y la seguridad de la cloroquina y sus derivados en pacientes con COVID-19.

Remdesivir Use Compared With Supportive Care in Hospitalized Patients With Severe COVID-19: A Single-Center Experience	https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa319	08/06/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1093/ofid/ofaa319	2328-8957	23288957	OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES	A3	1.317	45	3.66	 Abstract  Background The US Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for remdesivir use in patients with severe COVID-19.  Methods We utilized data from 2 quaternary acute care hospitals. The outcomes of interest were the impact of remdesivir on in-hospital death by day 28 and time to recovery, clinical improvement, and discharge. We utilized Cox proportional hazards models and stratified log-rank tests.  Results Two hundred twenty-four patients were included in the study. The median age was 59 years; 67.0% were male; 17/125 patients (13.6%) who received supportive care and 7/99 patients (7.1%) who received remdesivir died. The unadjusted risk for 28-day in-hospital death was lower for patients who received remdesivir compared with patients who received supportive care (hazard ratio [HR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.16–1.08). Although this trend remained the same after adjusting for age, sex, race, and oxygen requirements on admission (adjusted HR [aHR], 0.49; 95% CI, 0.19–1.28), as well as chronic comorbidities and use of corticosteroids (aHR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.16–1.23), it did not reach statistical significance. The use of remdesivir was not associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) or liver test abnormalities. Although not statistically significant, the rate ratios for time to recovery, clinical improvement, and discharge were higher in women and black or African American patients.  Conclusions Patients on remdesivir had lower, albeit not significant, all-cause in-hospital mortality, and the use of remdesivir did not increase the risk for AKI. Promising signals from this study need to be confirmed by future placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials.

Corticosteroid therapy for coronavirus disease 2019‑related acute respiratory distress syndrome: a cohort study with propensity score analysis.	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-020-03340-4	10/11/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1186/s13054-020-03340-4	1364-8535	13648535	CRITICAL CARE (LONDON. PRINT)	A1	3.218	185	8.76	 Abstract  Background The impact of corticosteroid therapy on outcomes of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly controversial. We aimed to compare the risk of death between COVID-19-related ARDS patients with corticosteroid treatment and those without.  Methods In this single-center retrospective observational study, patients with ARDS caused by COVID-19 between January 20, 2020, and February 24, 2020, were enrolled. The primary outcome was 60-day in-hospital death. The exposure was prescribed systemic corticosteroids or not. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 60-day in-hospital mortality.  Results A total of 382 patients [60.7 ± 14.1 years old (mean ± SD), 61.3% males] were analyzed. The median of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was 2.0 (IQR 2.0–3.0). Of these cases, 94 (24.6%) patients had invasive mechanical ventilation. The number of patients received systemic corticosteroids was 226 (59.2%), and 156 (40.8%) received standard treatment. The maximum dose of corticosteroids was 80.0 (IQR 40.0–80.0) mg equivalent methylprednisolone per day, and duration of corticosteroid treatment was 7.0 (4.0–12.0) days in total. In Cox regression analysis using corticosteroid treatment as a time-varying variable, corticosteroid treatment was associated with a significant reduction in risk of in-hospital death within 60 days after adjusting for age, sex, SOFA score at hospital admission, propensity score of corticosteroid treatment, comorbidities, antiviral treatment, and respiratory supports (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.21, 0.85;  p = 0.0160). Corticosteroids were not associated with delayed viral RNA clearance in our cohort.  Conclusion In this clinical practice setting, low-dose corticosteroid treatment was associated with reduced risk of in-hospital death within 60 days in COVID-19 patients who developed ARDS.

Impact of antihypertensive agents on clinical course and in-hospital mortality: analysis of 169 hypertensive patients hospitalized for COVID-19.	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.S2.71	21/09/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1590/1806-9282.66.S2.71	1806-9282	18069282	-	-	-	-	-	 SUMMARY  OBJECTIVE  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging health threat caused by a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2). Previous studies have noted hypertension is associated with increased mortality due to COVID-19; however, it is not clear whether the increased risk is due to hypertension itself or antihypertensive agents. We aimed to evaluate the impact of antihypertensive agents on the clinical outcomes of hypertensive patients with COVID-19.  METHODS  Our study included 169 consecutive hypertensive patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 between March 20 and April 10, 2020. The demographic characteristics, clinical data, and type of antihypertensive agents being used were reviewed.  RESULTS  The mean age of patients was 65.8±11.7 years.30 patients(17.7%) died during hospitalization. A total of 142 patients(84%) were using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), 91 (53.8%) were using diuretics, 69 (40.8%) were using calcium channel blockers (CCBs), 66 (39.1%) were using beta-blockers, 12 (7.1%) were using alpha-blockers, and 5 (2.9%) were using mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs). There was no significant difference between survivors and non-survivors based on the type of antihypertensive agents being used. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the type of the antihypertensive agent being used had no effect on mortality [OR=0.527 (0.130-2.138), p=0.370 for ACEIs/ARBs; OR=0.731 (0.296-1.808), p=0.498 for CCBs; OR=0.673 (0.254-1.782), p=0.425 for diuretics; OR=1.846 (0.688-4.950), p=0.223 for beta-blockers; OR=0.389 (0.089-1.695), p=0.208 for alpha-blockers; and OR=1.372 (0.107-17.639), p=0.808 for MRAs].  CONCLUSION  The type of antihypertensive agent being used had no effect on the clinical course and mortality in hypertensive patients with COVID-19. The use of these agents should be maintained for the treatment of hypertension during hospitalization.

CXCL10 could drive longer duration of mechanical ventilation during COVID-19 ARDS.	https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-020-03328-0	02/11/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-020-03328-0	1364-8535	13648535	CRITICAL CARE (LONDON. PRINT)	A1	3.218	185	8.76	 Abstract                  Background                 COVID-19-related ARDS has unique features when compared with ARDS from other origins, suggesting a distinctive inflammatory pathogenesis. Data regarding the host response within the lung are sparse. The objective is to compare alveolar and systemic inflammation response patterns, mitochondrial alarmin release, and outcomes according to ARDS etiology (i.e., COVID-19 vs. non-COVID-19).                                Methods                 Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and plasma were obtained from 7 control, 7 non-COVID-19 ARDS, and 14 COVID-19 ARDS patients. Clinical data, plasma, and epithelial lining fluid (ELF) concentrations of 45 inflammatory mediators and cell-free mitochondrial DNA were measured and compared.                                Results                 COVID-19 ARDS patients required mechanical ventilation (MV) for significantly longer, even after adjustment for potential confounders. There was a trend toward higher concentrations of plasma CCL5, CXCL2, CXCL10, CD40 ligand, IL-10, and GM-CSF, and ELF concentrations of CXCL1, CXCL10, granzyme B, TRAIL, and EGF in the COVID-19 ARDS group compared with the non-COVID-19 ARDS group. Plasma and ELF CXCL10 concentrations were independently associated with the number of ventilator-free days, without correlation between ELF CXCL-10 and viral load. Mitochondrial DNA plasma and ELF concentrations were elevated in all ARDS patients, with no differences between the two groups. ELF concentrations of mitochondrial DNA were correlated with alveolar cell counts, as well as IL-8 and IL-1β concentrations.                                Conclusion                 CXCL10 could be one key mediator involved in the dysregulated immune response. It should be evaluated as a candidate biomarker that may predict the duration of MV in COVID-19 ARDS patients. Targeting the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis could also be considered as a new therapeutic approach.

The therapeutic options have been explored either against hyperinflammation from dysregulated adaptive immunity or direct virus neutralization using antibodies from convalescent plasma (CP) of a recovered patient. The therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) for removal of excessive inflammatory cytokines has been tried with success in COVID-19. We undertook this exploratory study to evaluate safety and efficacy of TPE followed by CP transfusion in 14 patients with critical COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). All patients showed improvement in symptoms and decrease of inflammatory markers especially CRP (p = 0.03). 10 patients were liberated from IMV after a median of 5.5 (3-36) days, post sequential therapy. Day 7 and Day 28 mortality was 21.4% and 28.6% respectively. The median duration ICU and hospital LOS were 12 (5-42) days and 18 (12-47) days respectively. No patient developed transfusion-associated complications, but three patients developed secondary bacterial sepsis within 14 days of therapy, and one died.

On March 2020 tocilizumab - an anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody - was suggested as immunomodulatory treatment in severe COVID-19 because hyperinflammatory syndrome occurs in many patients similarly to the cytokine release syndrome that develops after CAR-T cell therapy. In our retrospective observational study, 20 severe COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care were treated with tocilizumab in addition to standard-of-care therapy (SOC) and compared with 13 COVID-19 patients receiving only SOC. Clinical respiratory status, inflammatory markers and vascular radiologic score improved after one week from tocilizumab administration. On the contrary, these parameters were stable or worsened in patients receiving only SOC. Despite major study limitations, improvement of alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient as well as vascular radiologic score after one week may account for improved pulmonary vascular perfusion and could explain the more rapid recovery of COVID-19 patients receiving tocilizumab compared to controls.	33161002	Immunology letters	1879-0542	10.1016/j.imlet.2020.10.009

The ACE-CoV study was designed to assess this question. The study was conducted in the Covid-Clinic-Toul cohort, which contains data about all patients hospitalized at Toulouse University hospital, France with a SARS-CoV-2 infection since March, 2020. We selected the patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (heart failure or coronary disease) and/or arterial hypertension. We conducted a subgroup analysis in patients with arterial hypertension. ACEI/ARB exposures at admission were assessed. The outcome was composite: admission to intensive care unit, need of mechanical ventilation or death during the 14 days after admission to hospital. We used logistic regression models with propensity scores (PS) weighted by overlap weighting (OW) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Between March 2020 and April 20, 2020, the Covid-Clinic-Toul included 263 patients. Among them, 111 were included in the ACE-CoV study population. In OW-PS-adjusted analyses, the association of exposure to ACEIs or ARBs with outcome occurrence was OR: 1.56 (95% CI: 0.73-3.33). It was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.68-1.45) for ACEIs and 1.64 (95% CI: 0.77-3.50) for ARBs. Analyses with weighting by the IPTW-PS method gave similar results. Results were similar when considering the subgroup of patients with arterial hypertension. The ACE-CoV study found no association between exposure to ACEIs or ARBs and unfavorable outcome in hospitalized patients for COVID-19 with a history of cardiovascular disease/arterial hypertension.	33111329	Fundamental & clinical pharmacology	1472-8206	10.1111/fcp.12613

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of favipiravir for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in outpatients and hospitalized patients. We conducted an open-label, randomized, active-controlled trial of a generic form of favipiravir in patients with COVID-19 confirmed by PCR-test. Eligible patients (18-60 years) after stratification were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive either favipiravir (1800 mg BID on day 1, followed by 800 mg BID for up to 9 days), or standard of care (SOC) treatment (umifenovir + intranasal interferon alpha-2b, or hydroxychloroquine) for up to 10 days. The co-primary outcomes were the time to clinical improvement and the time to viral clearance. Among 190 patients assessed for eligibility 168 were randomized to favipiravir (n=112) or to SOC (n=56) group.

Effect of Statin Therapy on SARS-CoV-2 Infection-Related Mortality in Hospitalized Patients	https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcvp/pvaa128	02/11/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1093/ehjcvp/pvaa128	2055-6837	20556837	European Heart Journal - Cardiovascular Pharmacotherapy	-	1.662	30	4.27	 Abstract                                   Aim                   Assessing the effect of statin therapy (ST) at hospital admission for COVID-19 on in-hospital mortality.                                                  Methods and results                    Retrospective observational study. Patients taking statins were 11 years older and had significantly more comorbidities than patients who were not taking statins. A genetic matching (GM) procedure was performed prior to analysis of the mortality risk. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for the cause-specific hazard (CSH) function, and a competing-risks Fine and Gray (FG) model was also used to study the direct effects of statins on risk. Data from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed 2157 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients [1234 men, 923 women; age: 67 y/o (IQR 54–78)] admitted to the hospital were retrieved from the clinical records in anonymized manner. Three hundred and fifty-three deaths occurred. Five hundred and eighty-one patients were taking statins. Univariate test after GM showed a significantly lower mortality rate in patients on ST than the matched non-statin group (19.8% vs. 25.4%, χ2 with Yates continuity correction: P = 0.027). The mortality rate was even lower in patients (n = 336) who maintained their statin treatments during hospitalization compared with the GM non-statin group (17.4%; P = 0.045). The Cox model applied to the CSH function [HR = 0.58(CI: 0.39–0.89); P = 0.01] and the competing-risks FG model [HR = 0.60 (CI: 0.39–0.92); P = 0.02] suggest that statins are associated with reduced COVID-19-related mortality.                                                  Conclusions                    A lower SARS-CoV-2 infection-related mortality was observed in patients treated with ST prior to hospitalization. Statin therapy should not be discontinued due to the global concern of the pandemic or in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

To compare the clinical outcomes between ICS users and nonusers, COVID-19-related claims in the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment database were evaluated. To evaluate susceptibility to COVID-19 among patients with COPD or asthma, a nested case-control study was performed using the same database. In total, 7341 patients were confirmed to have COVID-19, including 114 ICS users and 7227 nonusers. Among 5910 patients who were hospitalized, death was observed for 9% of ICS users and 4% of nonusers. However, this association was not significant when adjusted for age, sex, region, comorbidities, and hospital type (aOR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.43-2.07). The case-control analysis of COPD compared 640 cases with COVID-19 to 2560 matched controls without COVID-19, and the analysis of asthma compared 90 cases with COVID-19 to 360 matched controls without COVID-19. Use of ICS was not significantly associated with COVID-19 among patients with COPD (aOR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.46-2.25) or asthma (aOR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.13-1.17).

A Case Control Study to Evaluate the Impact of Colchicine on Patients Admitted to the Hospital with Moderate to Severe COVID-19 Infection	https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8865954	27/10/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1155/2020/8865954	1918-1493	19181493	Canadian Journal of Infectious Diseases and Medical Microbiology	-	0.590	41	2.59	 Background. Colchicine has been used in conditions such as periodic febrile illness, acute pericarditis, and gouty arthritis, all having a common hyperinflammatory response as seen in moderate to severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This project was carried out during the rapid surge of cases in New York City, and the goal was to assess the efficacy of colchicine in treating patients with COVID-19. Methods. Patients admitted to two distinct pulmonary oriented floors of the BronxCare Hospital Center were compared. Patients on one floor were given colchicine in addition to standard of care, while control patients from another floor received only standard of care. Patients who had at least two separate timepoint measurements for at least two out of four serum inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, ferritin, or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) were selected for the final comprehensive analysis. Results. An initial analysis performed on all patients, irrespective of the availability of two timepoint inflammatory markers, revealed a lower mortality (49.1% versus 72.9%, <jats:inline-formula>                     <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M1">                        <mi>P</mi>                        <mo>=</mo>                        <mn>0.002</mn>                     </math>                  </jats:inline-formula>), a lower percentage of intubations (52.8% versus 73.6%, <jats:inline-formula>                     <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M2">                        <mi>P</mi>                        <mo>=</mo>                        <mn>0.006</mn>                     </math>                  </jats:inline-formula>), and a higher discharge rate (50.9% versus 27.1%, <jats:inline-formula>                     <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M3">                        <mi>P</mi>                        <mo>=</mo>                        <mn>0.002</mn>                     </math>                  </jats:inline-formula>), in the patients who received colchicine.

Methods                 A multicenter, single-arm, hypothesis-driven trial was planned, according to a phase 2 design, to study the effect of tocilizumab on lethality rates at 14 and 30 days (co-primary endpoints, a priori expected rates being 20 and 35%, respectively). A further prospective cohort of patients, consecutively enrolled after the first cohort was accomplished, was used as a secondary validation dataset. The two cohorts were evaluated jointly in an exploratory multivariable logistic regression model to assess prognostic variables on survival.                                Results                 In the primary intention-to-treat (ITT) phase 2 population, 180/301 (59.8%) subjects received tocilizumab, and 67 deaths were observed overall. Lethality rates were equal to 18.4% (97.5% CI: 13.6–24.0,  P = 0.52) and 22.4% (97.5% CI: 17.2–28.3,  P &lt; 0.001) at 14 and 30 days, respectively. Lethality rates were lower in the validation dataset, that included 920 patients. No signal of specific drug toxicity was reported. In the exploratory multivariable logistic regression analysis, older age and lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio negatively affected survival, while the concurrent use of steroids was associated with greater survival. A statistically significant interaction was found between tocilizumab and respiratory support, suggesting that tocilizumab might be more effective in patients not requiring mechanical respiratory support at baseline.                                Conclusions                 Tocilizumab reduced lethality rate at 30 days compared with null hypothesis, without significant toxicity. Possibly, this effect could be limited to patients not requiring mechanical respiratory support at baseline.

We aimed to determine whether COVID-19 mortality was affected by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels, vitamin D status, or cholecalciferol therapy, and to elucidate any other predictors of COVID-19 mortality. Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were opportunistically recruited from three UK hospitals, and their data were collected retrospectively. Logistic regression was used to determine any relationships between COVID-19 mortality and potential predictors, including 25(OH)D levels and cholecalciferol booster therapy. A total of 986 participants with COVID-19 were studied, of whom 151 (16.0%) received cholecalciferol booster therapy. In the primary cohort of 444 patients, cholecalciferol booster therapy was associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality, following adjustment for potential confounders (OR	34674735	Journal of translational medicine	1479-5876	10.1186/s12967-021-03094-9
The Use of Therapeutic-Dose Anticoagulation and Its Effect on Mortality in Patients With COVID-19: A Systematic Review	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1076029620960797	20/10/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1177/1076029620960797	1076-0296	10760296	CLINICAL AND APPLIED THROMBOSIS/HEMOSTASIS	B1	0.758	55	2.76	  The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) events in patients with COVID-19 treated with a standard thromboprophylaxis dose of anticoagulants remains high. We conducted a systematic review in order to explore the association between therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and its effect on mortality in patients with COVID-19. A systematic search was carried out using the electronic databases of PubMed, EuropePMC, and the Cochrane Central Database, using specific keywords. All articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the qualitative analysis. There were 8 observational studies included in the final qualitative analysis. Quality assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) showed a mean score of 7.5 ± 1.06, indicating moderate to high quality of the studies. Three retrospective cohort studies reported a reduction in the mortality rate, while 6 other studies showed no mortality benefits among patients with COVID-19 treated with therapeutic-dose anticoagulation. There was a slight tendency toward a reduction in the mortality rate among mechanically-ventilated patients with COVID-19 receiving therapeutic-dose anticoagulation. Bleeding events and thrombotic complications among patients receiving therapeutic-dose anticoagulation were reported in 3 studies. Although it is too soon to draw any conclusions, this systematic review draws attention to current evidence regarding the association between therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and its effect on mortality in patients with COVID-19.

To evaluate the adjuvant use of systemic oxygen-ozone administration in the early control of disease progression in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. PROBIOZOVID is an ongoing, interventional, randomized, prospective, and double-arm trial enrolling patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. From a total of 85 patients screened, 28 were recruited. Patients were randomly divided into ozone-autohemotherapy group (14) and control group (14). The procedure consisted in a daily double-treatment with systemic Oxygen-ozone administration for 7 days. All patients were treated with ad interim best available therapy. The primary outcome was delta in the number of patients requiring orotracheal-intubation despite treatment. Secondary outcome was the difference of mortality between the two groups. Moreover, hematological parameters were compared before and after treatment. No differences in the characteristics between groups were observed at baseline. As a preliminary report we have observed that one patient for each group needed intubation and was transferred to ITU. No deaths were observed at 7-14 days of follow up. Thirty-day mortality was 8.3% for ozone group and 10% for controls. Ozone therapy did not significantly influence inflammation markers, hematology profile, and lymphocyte subpopulations of patients treated. Ozone therapy had an impact on the need for the ventilatory support, although did not reach statistical significance. Finally, no adverse events related to the use of ozone-autohemotherapy were reported. Preliminary results, although not showing statistically significant benefits of ozone on COVID-19, did not report any toxicity.	33111980	Journal of medical virology	1096-9071	10.1002/jmv.26636

Here we evaluated the efficacy of the Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) and its combination with other drugs in the treatment of COVID-19. We included 170 confirmed COVID-19 patients who had been cured and discharged. Their antiviral therapies were LPV/r alone or combinations with interferon (IFN), Novaferon and Arbidol. We evaluated the medication efficacy by comparing the time of the negative nucleic acid conversion and the length of hospitalization mainly. The LPV/r + Novaferon [6.00 (4.00-8.00) and 7.50 (5.00-10.00) days] had shorter time of the negative nucleic acid conversion (P = .0036) and shorter time of hospitalization (P < .001) compared with LPV/r alone [9.00 (5.00-12.00) and 12.00 (11.00-15.00) days] and LPV/r + IFN [9.00 (7.25-11.00) and 12.00 (10.00-13.50) days]. On the contrary, LPV/r + IFN [9.00 (7.25-11.00) and 12.00 (10.00-13.50) days] had shorter time of the negative nucleic acid conversion (P = .031) and shorter time of hospitalization (P < .001) compared with LPV/r + IFN +Novaferon [10.00 (8.00-11.25) and 13.50 (11.50-17.00) days] and LPV/r + IFN +Arbidol [14.00 (9.75-19.00) and 19.50 (13.25-24.00) days]. In conclusion, the combination of LPV/r and Novaferon may have better efficacy against COVID-19. However, adding IFN based on LPV/r + Novaferon or adding Arbidol based on LPV/r + IFN may not improve the efficacy.	33090501	Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology	1440-1681	10.1111/1440-1681.13425

We identified a total of 102 eligible studies for systematic review, in which 49 studies adjusting for confounders were included in the meta-analysis. We found no association between prior ACEI/ARB use and risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the general population (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], .94-1.05). The risk of mortality (aOR, .87; 95% CI, .66-1.04) and severe outcomes (aOR, .95; 95% CI, .73-1.24) were also unchanged among COVID-19 patients taking ACEIs/ARBs. These findings remained consistent in subgroup analyses stratified by populations, drug exposures, and other secondary outcomes. This systematic review provides evidence-based support to current medical guidelines and position statements that ACEIs/ARBs should not be discontinued. Additionally, there has been no evidence for initiating ACEI/ARB regimen as prevention or treatment of COVID-19.	33079200	Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America	1537-6591	10.1093/cid/ciaa1592

Previous studies showed RAAS inhibitors increase the expression of ACE2, a cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which provokes a concern that the use of ACEI and ARB in hypertensive individuals might lead to increased mortality and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To further investigate the effects of ACEI/ARB on COVID-19 patients, we systematically reviewed relevant studies that met predetermined inclusion criteria in search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library databases, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. The search strategy included clinical data published through October 12, 2020. Twenty-six studies involving 8104 hypertensive patients in ACEI/ARB-treated group and 8203 hypertensive patients in non-ACEI/ARB-treated group were analyzed.

Hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin have been widely used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) despite a paucity of evidence regarding efficacy. The incidence of torsade de pointes remains unknown. Widespread use of these medications forced overwhelmed health care systems to search for ways to effectively monitor these patients while simultaneously trying to minimize health care provider exposure and use of personal protective equipment.                                  Methods:             Patients with COVID-19 positive who received hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin across 13 hospitals between March 1 and April 15 were included in this study. A comprehensive search of the electronic medical records was performed using a proprietary python script to identify any mention of QT prolongation, ventricular tachy-arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.                                  Results:             The primary outcome of torsade de pointes was observed in 1 (0.015%) out of 6476 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin. Sixty-seven (1.03%) had hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin held or discontinued due to an average QT prolongation of 60.5±40.5 ms from a baseline QTc of 473.7±35.9 ms to a peak QTc of 532.6±31.6 ms. Of these patients, hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin were discontinued in 58 patients (86.6%), while one or more doses of therapy were held in the remaining nine (13.4%). A simplified approach to monitoring for QT prolongation and arrythmia was implemented on April 5. There were no deaths related to the medications with the simplified monitoring approach and health care provider exposure was reduced.                                  Conclusions:             The risk of torsade de pointes is low in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin therapy.

This multicenter, prospective, open-label, uncontrolled study aimed to assess the use of subcutaneous tocilizumab in adult patients with severe and critical COVID-19. Tocilizumab was added to the standard care of therapy at a dose of 324 mg (<100 kg bodyweight) or 486 mg (≥100 kg bodyweight). The study endpoints were all-cause mortality rate, changes in oxygen-support level, oxygen saturation, body temperature, respiratory rate, and laboratory variables during the study, and drug safety. Of 126 patients enrolled, 86 had severe and 40 had critical disease. Most patients were male (63.49%) and aged below 65 (78.57%). By day 14 of the study, 4.65% (4/86) of severe patients and 50.00% (20/40) of critical patients died. By the end, 6.98% (6/86) of severe patients and 60.00% (24/40) of critical patients died.Outcomes concerning three additional endpoints (oral temperature, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate)were significantly improved as early as three days after tocilizumab administration in both groups of subjects, more considerably in severe patients. Significant improvement in the required level of oxygenation was reported in severe patients seven days after tocilizumab administration.

The Outcome of Hydroxychloroquine in Patients Treated for COVID-19: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/4312519	13/10/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1155/2020/4312519	1916-7245	19167245	Canadian Respiratory Journal	-	0.552	56	2.4	 Background. The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in an unprecedented public health challenge worldwide. Despite urgent and extensive global efforts, the existing evidence is inconclusive regarding the medications used for the treatment of COVID-19. Purpose. To generate an up-to-date evidence for the clinical safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without azithromycin (AZ) among patients treated for COVID-19. Data Source. PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, LITCOVID, Web of Science, SCOPUS, BioRxiv, Embase, MedRxiv, and Wiley online library were searched from 2019/12/30 to 2020/05/23. Study Selection. Three investigators assessed the quality of the studies. Data Extraction. Data about study characteristics, effect estimates, and the quality of the studies were extracted by two independent reviewers and cross-checked by the third reviewer. Data Synthesis. The data of 6,782 (HCQ group, 3623; HCQ + AZ group, 1,020; control group, 2139) participants were included. HCQ was compared with standard care for virologic efficacy, disease progression, mortality, and adverse effects. HCQ was also compared with HCQ + AZ for QTc prolongation, admission to the intensive care unit, and mortality. The study found HCQ did not alter the rate of virologic cure (OR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.39–1.56) and the risk of mortality (OR = 1.26; 95% CI: 0.66–2.39). The pooled prevalence for mortality was 5.8% (95% CI: 0.9%–10.8%). Moreover, HCQ did not impact disease progression (OR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.36–2.29) but resulted in a higher risk of adverse effects (OR = 2.35; 95% CI: 1.15–4.8). HCQ was also compared against HCQ + AZ, and no difference was observed in QTc prolongation above 500 ms (OR = 1.11; 95% CI: 0.54–2.28), admission to the intensive care unit (OR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.52–1.63), and mortality (OR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.55–1.43). However, in the analysis of single-arm studies, about 11.2% (95% CI: 7.0%–15.5%) of patients have developed an absolute increase of QTc greater than 500 ms, and 4.1% (95% CI: 1.1%–7.1%) of patients discontinued their medication. Conclusion. This meta-analysis and systematic review, which included a limited number of poorly designed studies of patients with COVID-19, revealed HCQ is intolerable, unsafe, and not efficacious. Similarly, HCQ + AZ combination was not different from HCQ alone in curbing mortality and ICU admission.	['Hidroxicloroquina']	['Hydroxychloroquine']	-	-	-	-	-
Statin use is associated with lower disease severity in COVID‑19 infection	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74492-0	15/10/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1038/s41598-020-74492-0	2045-2322	20452322	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS	A2	1.005	242	4.81	 Abstract We aim to study the association of hyperlipidemia and statin use with COVID-19 severity. We analysed a retrospective cohort of 717 patients admitted to a tertiary centre in Singapore for COVID-19 infection. Clinical outcomes of interest were oxygen saturation ≤ 94% requiring supplemental oxygen, intensive-care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical-ventilation and death. Patients on long term dyslipidaemia medications (statins, fibrates or ezetimibe) were considered to have dyslipidaemia. Logistic regression models were used to study the association between dyslipidaemia and clinical outcomes adjusted for age, gender and ethnicity. Statin treatment effect was determined, in a nested case–control design, through logistic treatment models with 1:3 propensity matching for age, gender and ethnicity. All statistical tests were two-sided, and statistical significance was taken as  p &lt; 0.05. One hundred fifty-six (21.8%) patients had dyslipidaemia and 97% of these were on statins. Logistic treatment models showed a lower chance of ICU admission for statin users when compared to non-statin users (ATET: Coeff (risk difference): − 0.12 (− 0.23, − 0.01);  p = 0.028). There were no other significant differences in other outcomes. Statin use was independently associated with lower ICU admission. This supports current practice to continue prescription of statins in COVID-19 patients.	['Estatina', 'Ezetimiba', 'Fibratos']	['Statin', 'Ezetimibe', 'Fibrates']	-	-	-	-	-

Efficacy of umifenovir in the treatment of mild and moderate COVID-19 patients	https://doi.org/10.26452/ijrps.v11iSPL1.2839	15/10/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.26452/ijrps.v11iSPL1.2839	0975-7538	09757538	-	-	-	-	-	 The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak was initially reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Many cases of pneumonia without any apparent cause were described to be associated with seafood and wet markets in Wuhan. At present, there are no effective antiviral drugs to treat COVID-19. Umifenovir is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug used for treating several viral infections, and it reportedly inhibits SARS-CoV replication in vitro. This exploratory randomized and controlled study recruited 30 COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital until May 18, 2020. Fifteen (15) eligible patients randomly allocated underwent umifenovir therapy (600 mg/d). Time to clinical recovery (TTCR), clinical characteristics, and tomographic results were analyzed at baseline and five days after treatment to assess the effect of umifenovir. Thirty (30) COVID-19 patients (mean age: 36.5 years [SD: 12.1, range: 19-59]), including 18 (60%) males and 12 (40%) females, were recruited for the study. There were no significant differences in age or gender, but there were significant differences in TTCR among the two categories. Body temperature (BT) and cough recuperation time [2.8 (0.6) and 2.6 (0.6) days, respectively] were highly reduced in the umifenovir category at 2.4 and 2.1 days, respectively. Moreover, many patients treated with umifenovir exhibited no side effects. In this study, pneumonia was ameliorated in 76.6% (23/30) of the patients, with moderate and potential amelioration in 36.6% and 40% of the patients, respectively. In addition, 66.6% of the patients in the umifenovir category had potential pneumonia absorption.	['Umifenovir']	['Umifenovir']	-	-	-	-	-
Preemptive interleukin‐6 blockade in patients with COVID‐19	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74001-3	08/10/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1038/s41598-020-74001-3	2045-2322	20452322	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS	A2	1.005	242	4.81	 Abstract Excessive interleukin-6 signaling is a key factor contributing to the cytokine release syndrome implicated in clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Preliminary results suggest that tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody, may be beneficial in severely ill patients, but no data are available on earlier stages of disease. An anticipated blockade of interleukin-6 might hypothetically prevent the catastrophic consequences of the overt cytokine storm. We evaluated early-given tocilizumab in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and identified outcome predictors. Consecutive patients with initial Sequential-Organ-Failure-Assessment (SOFA) score &lt; 3 fulfilling pre-defined criteria were treated with tocilizumab. Serial plasma biomarkers and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected. Of 193 patients admitted with COVID-19, 64 met the inclusion criteria. After tocilizumab, 49 (76.6%) had an early favorable response. Adjusted predictors of response were gender, SOFA score, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, Charlson comorbidity index and systolic blood pressure. At week-4, 56.1% of responders and 30% of non-responders had cleared the SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharynx. Temporal profiles of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, NT-ProBNP, D-dimer, and cardiac-troponin-I differed according to tocilizumab response and discriminated final in-hospital outcome. No deaths or disease recurrences were observed. Preemptive therapy with tocilizumab was safe and associated with favorable outcomes in most patients. Biological and clinical markers predicted outcomes.	['Tocilizumabe']	['Tocilizumab']	-	-	-	-	-

In this health emergency, it might be useful to look into the old therapies which could be effective against the virus. In vitro research showed Ivermectin could decrease the concentration of coronavirus 4000 to 5000 folds in living lung tissue.&#x0D;Aim: In this prospective study a combination of Ivermectin and Doxycycline will be evaluated therapeutically to treat COVID-19 patients. Methods: 100 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this study with a predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. RT- PCR of the SERS-CoV-2 will be done at designated government hospitals. The clinical features and response to treatment were noted according to a dedicated protocol.&#x0D;Results: In this study male and female were 64 and 36 respectively, the age ranged between 8 to 84 years. Retesting was done between 4 and 18 days of starting medication. All patients tested negative and their symptoms improved within 72 hours.

Efficacy of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 ARDS undergoing noninvasive ventilation	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-020-03306-6	29/09/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1186/s13054-020-03306-6	1364-8535	13648535	CRITICAL CARE (LONDON. PRINT)	A1	3.218	185	8.76	 Abstract  Background The severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is extremely variable, ranging from asymptomatic patients to those who develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). As for now, there are still no really effective therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Some evidences suggest that tocilizumab (TCZ) may avoid the progression of severe COVID-19. The aim of this retrospective case-control study was to analyze the efficacy and safety of TCZ in patients with COVID-19 ARDS undergoing noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV).  Methods Seventy-nine consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and worsening acute respiratory failure (ARF) were admitted to the Pulmonology Unit of Azienda USL of Reggio Emilia-IRCCS. All patients were inflamed (elevated CRP and IL-6 levels) and received NIV at admission according to the presence of a pO 2/FiO 2 ratio ≤ 200 mmHg. The possibility of being treated with TCZ depended on the drug availability. The primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality rate. A secondary composite outcome of worsening was represented by the patients who died in the pulmonology unit or were intubated.  Results Out of 79 patients, 41 were treated with TCZ. Twenty-eight patients received intravenous (IV) TCZ and 13 patients received subcutaneous (SC) TCZ. In-hospital overall mortality rate was 38% (30/79 patients). The probabilities of dying and being intubated during the follow-up using Kaplan-Meier method were significantly lower in total patients treated with TCZ compared to those of patients not treated with TCZ (log-rank  p value = 0.006 and 0.036, respectively). However, using Cox multivariate analyses adjusted for age and Charlson comorbidity index only the association with the reduced risk of being intubated or dying maintained the significance (HR 0.44, 95%CI 0.22–0.89,  p = 0.022). Two patients treated with TCZ developed cavitating lung lesions during the follow-up.  Conclusions This study shows that TCZ treatment may be effective in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory impairment receiving NIV. More data on safety are required. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these results.

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous injection of interferon alpha-2b (IFN alpha-2b) combined with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) in the treatment of COVID-19 infection, compared with that of using LPV/r alone.  Methods Patients diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wuhan Red Cross hospital during the period from January 23, 2020 to March 19, 2020 were included. The length of stay, the time to viral clearance and adverse reactions during hospitalization were compared between patients using oral LPV/r and combined therapy of LPV/r and subcutaneous injection of IFN alpha-2b.  Results A total of 22 patients were treated with LPV/r alone and 19 with combined therapy with subcutaneous injection of IFN alpha-2b. The average length of hospitalization in the combination group was shorter than that of LPV/r group (16 ± 9.7 vs 23 ± 10.5 days;  P = 0.028). Moreover, the days of hospitalization in early intervention group decreased from 25 ± 8.5 days to 10 ± 2.9 days compared with delayed intervention group ( P = 0.001). Combined therapy with IFN alpha-2b also significantly reduced the duration of detectable virus in the upper respiratory tract. No patient in each group was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) or died during the treatment. There was no significant difference in the adverse effect composition between two groups.  Conclusions Subcutaneous injection of IFN alpha-2b combined with LPV/r shortened the length of hospitalization and accelerated viral clearance in COVID-19 patients, which deserves further investigation in clinical practice.

However, little is known about the effects of pre-admission and/or in-hospital antihypertension treatments on clinical outcomes. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the association between in-hospital blood pressure (BP) control and COVID-19-related outcomes and to compare the effects of different antihypertension treatments. This study included 2864 COVID-19 patients and 1628 were hypertensive. Patients were grouped according to their BP during hospitalization and records of medication application. Patients with higher BP showed worse cardiac and renal functions and clinical outcomes. After adjustment, subjects with pre-admission usage of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors (HR = 0.35, 95%CI 0.14-0.86, P = .022) had a lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes, including death, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, septic shock, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit admission. Particularly, hypertension patients receiving RAAS inhibitor treatment either before (HR = 0.35, 95%CI 0.13-0.97, P = .043) or after (HR = 0.18, 95%CI 0.04-0.86, P = .031) admission showed a significantly lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes than those receiving application of other antihypertensive medicines. Furthermore, consecutive application of RAAS inhibitors in COVID-19 patients with hypertension showed better clinical outcomes (HR = 0.10, 95%CI 0.01-0.83, P = .033) than non-RAAS inhibitors users. We revealed that COVID-19 patients with poor BP control during hospitalization had worse clinical outcomes. Compared with other antihypertension medicines, RAAS inhibitors were beneficial for improving clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with hypertension. Our findings provide direct evidence to support the administration of RAAS inhibitors to COVID-19 patients with hypertension before and after admission.	33006442	Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.)	1751-7176	10.1111/jch.14038

Hydroxychloroquine is effective, and consistently so used early, for Covid-19: A systematic review	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100776	05/10/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100776	2052-2975	20522975	NEW MICROBES NEW INFECT	B2	0.737	33	3.44	-	['Hidroxicloroquina']	['Hydroxychloroquine']	Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has shown efficacy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in some but not all studies. We hypothesized that a systematic review would show HCQ to be effective against COVID-19, more effective when provided earlier, not associated with worsening disease and safe. We searched PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Google Scholar and Google for all reports on HCQ as a treatment for COVID-19 patients. This included preprints and preliminary reports on larger COVID-19 studies. We examined the studies for efficacy, time of administration and safety. HCQ was found to be consistently effective against COVID-19 when provided early in the outpatient setting. It was also found to be overall effective in inpatient studies. No unbiased study found worse outcomes with HCQ use. No mortality or serious safety adverse events were found. HCQ is consistently effective against COVID-19 when provided early in the outpatient setting, it is overall effective against COVID-19, it has not produced worsening of disease and it is safe.	33042552	New microbes and new infections	2052-2975	10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100776

Effects of Short-Term Low-Dose Glucocorticoids for Patients with Mild COVID-19	https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/2854186	24/09/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1155/2020/2854186	2314-6133	23146133	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL	A3	0.647	147	3.5	  Objectives. To evaluate the role of short-term low-dose glucocorticoids in mild COVID-19 patients.  Methods. We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional, single-center study in Kunming, China. A total of 33 mild COVID-19 cases were divided into two treatment groups (with and without glucocorticoids, methylprednisolone, were used in this setting), and the absolute value of peripheral blood lymphocyte count; CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell counts; and the time to achieve negative transformation of a nucleic acid pharyngeal swab were recorded. Peripheral blood lymphocyte and T cell counts were compared between the treatment group and 25 healthy individuals. At the point of time when there was a 50% accumulation conversion rate (positive to negative nucleic acid on pharyngeal swab), and the nucleic acid turned negative in half of the patients in two groups, the peripheral blood lymphocyte and T cell counts were compared between treatment groups.  Results. The mean cumulative time for the 50% negative conversion rate of the nucleic acid in the pharyngeal swab was <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M1"><mml:mn>17.7</mml:mn><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mn>5.1</mml:mn></mml:math> days and <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M2"><mml:mn>13.9</mml:mn><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mn>5.4</mml:mn></mml:math> days in the glucocorticoid group and the nonglucocorticoid group, respectively. The absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte count and the T cell subset count in the glucocorticoid group were lower than those in the nonglucocorticoid group. When the nucleic acid turned negative in half of the patients, the absolute value of peripheral blood lymphocyte count and CD4+ T cells of the glucocorticoid group and the nonglucocorticoid group was not significantly different; the CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in the glucocorticoid group were lower than those in the nonglucocorticoid group. The absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte count, CD3+ T cells, and CD4+ T cells in the glucocorticoid group were lower than those of the healthy group during the whole disease period, and CD8+ T cells returned to normal at 19-21 days of the disease period. There was no significant difference between the nonglucocorticoid group and the healthy group for absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte and CD8+ T cells; moreover, CD3+ T cells and CD4+ T cells were lower in the nonglucocorticoid group than those in the healthy group from the day of admission to the 18th day and returned to normal at the period of 19-21 days.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 10, 2020 and July 31, 2020 at seven hospitals in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Outcomes included clinical improvement within 30 days (primary) and in-hospital mortality (secondary). Of 766 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 500 (65.6%) were male, with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 46 (34-58) years. One hundred ninety-one (25%) patients had severe/critical disease requiring admission in the intensive care unit (ICU). Six hundred twenty patients (80.9%) improved and were discharged within 30 days of admission. Overall in-hospital mortality was 13.2% (95% CI: 10.9-15.8), and almost 50% among those in the ICU. Independent risk factors for death were age < 20 years (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 6.62, 95% CI: 1.85-23.64), 40-59 years (aHR = 4.45, 95% CI: 1.83-10.79), and ≥ 60 years (aHR = 13.63, 95% CI: 5.70-32.60) compared with those aged 20-39 years, with obesity (aHR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.24-4.27), and with chronic kidney disease (aHR = 5.33, 95% CI: 1.85-15.35).

SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates associated with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239252	17/09/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1371/journal.pone.0239252	1932-6203	19326203	PLOS ONE	A1	0.852	367	3.8	-	['Vitamina D (25-hidroxivitamina D)']	['Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D)']	Until treatment and vaccine for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) becomes widely available, other methods of reducing infection rates should be explored. This study used a retrospective, observational analysis of deidentified tests performed at a national clinical laboratory to determine if circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels are associated with severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity rates. Over 190,000 patients from all 50 states with SARS-CoV-2 results performed mid-March through mid-June, 2020 and matching 25(OH)D results from the preceding 12 months were included. Residential zip code data was required to match with US Census data and perform analyses of race/ethnicity proportions and latitude. A total of 191,779 patients were included (median age, 54 years [interquartile range 40.4-64.7]; 68% female. The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was 9.3% (95% C.I. 9.2-9.5%) and the mean seasonally adjusted 25(OH)D was 31.7 (SD 11.7). The SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate was higher in the 39,190 patients with "deficient" 25(OH)D values (<20 ng/mL) (12.5%, 95% C.I. 12.2-12.8%) than in the 27,870 patients with "adequate" values (30-34 ng/mL) (8.1%, 95% C.I. 7.8-8.4%) and the 12,321 patients with values ≥55 ng/mL (5.9%, 95% C.I. 5.5-6.4%). The association between 25(OH)D levels and SARS-CoV-2 positivity was best fitted by the weighted second-order polynomial regression, which indicated strong correlation in the total population (R2 = 0.96) and in analyses stratified by all studied demographic factors. The association between lower SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates and higher circulating 25(OH)D levels remained significant in a multivariable logistic model adjusting for all included demographic factors (adjusted odds ratio 0.984 per ng/mL increment, 95% C.I. 0.983-0.986; p<0.001). SARS-CoV-2 positivity is strongly and inversely associated with circulating 25(OH)D levels, a relationship that persists across latitudes, races/ethnicities, both sexes, and age ranges. Our findings provide impetus to explore the role of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.	32941512	PloS one	1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0239252

We studied the impact of tAC and pAC compared with no anticoagulation (AC) on time to death in COVID-19. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 127 deceased COVID-19 patients and compared time to death in those who received tAC (n = 67), pAC (n = 47), and no AC (n = 13). Median time to death was longer with higher doses of AC (11 days for tAC, 8 days for pAC, and 4 days for no AC, p &lt; 0.001). In multivariate analysis, AC was associated with longer time to death, both at prophylactic (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15 to 0.58; p &lt; 0.001) and therapeutic doses (HR = 0.15; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.32; p &lt; 0.001) compared with no AC. Bleeding rates were similar among tAC and remaining patients (19 vs. 18%; p = 0.877). In deceased COVID-19 patients, AC was associated with a delay in death in a dose-dependent manner. Randomized trials are required to prospectively investigate the benefit and safety of higher doses of AC in this population.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS                   In a multicenter, case-control, retrospective, observational study, sitagliptin, an oral and highly selective dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, was added to standard of care (e.g., insulin administration) at the time of hospitalization in patients with type 2 diabetes who were hospitalized with COVID-19. Every center also recruited at a 1:1 ratio untreated control subjects matched for age and sex. All patients had pneumonia and exhibited oxygen saturation &amp;lt;95% when breathing ambient air or when receiving oxygen support. The primary end points were discharge from the hospital/death and improvement of clinical outcomes, defined as an increase in at least two points on a seven-category modified ordinal scale. Data were collected retrospectively from patients receiving sitagliptin from 1 March through 30 April 2020.                                                  RESULTS                   Of the 338 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes and COVID-19 admitted in Northern Italy hospitals included in this study, 169 were on sitagliptin, while 169 were on standard of care. Treatment with sitagliptin at the time of hospitalization was associated with reduced mortality (18% vs. 37% of deceased patients; hazard ratio 0.44 [95% CI 0.29–0.66]; P = 0.0001), with an improvement in clinical outcomes (60% vs. 38% of improved patients; P = 0.0001) and with a greater number of hospital discharges (120 vs. 89 of discharged patients; P = 0.0008) compared with patients receiving standard of care, respectively.                                                  CONCLUSIONS                   In this multicenter, case-control, retrospective, observational study of patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to the hospital for COVID-19, sitagliptin treatment at the time of hospitalization was associated with reduced mortality and improved clinical outcomes as compared with standard-of-care treatment.

This study evaluated the outcome of ivermectin treated mild to moderate COVID-19 cases compared to usual care.&#x0D;Methods: This open-label randomised controlled study was conducted at a sub-district (Upazila) health complex from 1st May 2020 to the end of July 2020. Consecutive RT-PCR positive eligible COVID-19 patients were randomised into control and intervention arms. In the intervention arm, ivermectin 200 micrograms/kg single dose was administered orally in addition to usual care and was followed up till recovery. Repeat RT-PCR was done on day ten since the first positive result. The end point with regard to treatment outcome was time required for the resolution of symptoms from the onset of the symptoms and following enrollement in the study.&#x0D;Results: A total of 62 mild to moderate COVID-19 patients were enrolled in the study. There were 30 patients in the control arm and 32 patients in the intervention arm. Total recovery time from the onset of symptoms to complete resolution of symptoms of the patients in the intervention arm was 10.09 ± 3.236 days, compared to 11.50 ± 5.32 days in the control arm (95% CI -0.860,3.627, p&gt;. 05) and was not significantly different. The mean recovery time after enrolment in the intervention arm was 5.31 ± 2.48 days, which also did not differ significantly from the control arm of 6.33 ± 4.23 days (95% CI – 0.766, 2.808, p&gt; 0.05). Results of negative repeat RT- PCR were not significantly different between control and intervention arms (control 90% vs intervention 95%, p&gt;.05).&#x0D;Conclusion: Ivermectin had no beneficial effect on the disease course over usual care in mild to moderate COVID-19 cases.&#x0D;Ibrahim Med.

The association of treatment with hydroxychloroquine and hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-020-02505-x	30/09/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1007/s11739-020-02505-x	1828-0447	18280447	INTERN EMERG MED	A2	0.861	51	2.77	 Abstract This study investigates the association between the treatment with hydroxychloroquine and mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19. Routinely recorded, clinical data, up to the 24th of April 2020, from the 2075 patients with COVID-19, admitted in 17 hospitals in Spain between the 1st of March and the 20th of April 2020 were used. The following variables were extracted for this study: age, gender, temperature, and saturation of oxygen on admission, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, heparin, steroids, tocilizumab, a combination of lopinavir with ritonavir, and oseltamivir, together with data on mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations. At the time of collecting the data, 301 patients had died, 1449 had been discharged home from the hospitals, 240 were still admitted, and 85 had been transferred to hospitals not included in the study. Median follow-up time was 8 (IQR 5–12) days. Hydroxychloroquine had been used in 1857 patients. Hydroxychloroquine was associated with lower mortality when the model was adjusted for age and gender, with OR (95% CI): 0.44 (0.29–0.67). This association remained significant when saturation of oxygen &lt; 90% and temperature &gt; 37 °C were added to de model with OR 0.45 (0.30–0.68)  p &lt; 0.001, and also when all the other drugs, and time of admission, were included as covariates. The association between hydroxychloroquine and lower mortality observed in this study can be acknowledged by clinicians in hospitals and in the community. Randomized-controlled trials to assess the causal effects of hydroxychloroquine in different therapeutic regimes are required.

Treating Covid-19 With Hydroxychloroquine (TEACH): A Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized Controlled Trial in Hospitalized Patients	https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa446	23/09/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1093/ofid/ofaa446	2328-8957	23288957	OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES	A3	1.317	45	3.66	 Abstract                                   Background                   Effective therapies to combat coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has in vitro antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but the clinical benefit of HCQ in treating COVID-19 is unclear. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of HCQ for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.                                                  Methods                   We conducted a multicenter, double-blind randomized clinical trial of HCQ among patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to HCQ or placebo for 5 days and followed for 30 days. The primary efficacy outcome was a severe disease progression composite end point (death, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and/or vasopressor use) at day 14.                                                  Results                   A total of 128 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were similar between the HCQ (n = 67) and placebo (n = 61) arms. At day 14, 11 (16.4%) subjects assigned to HCQ and 6 (9.8%) subjects assigned to placebo met the severe disease progression end point, but this did not achieve statistical significance (P = .350). There were no significant differences in COVID-19 clinical scores, number of oxygen-free days, SARS-CoV-2 clearance, or adverse events between HCQ and placebo. HCQ was associated with a slight increase in mean corrected QT interval, an increased D-dimer, and a trend toward an increased length of stay.                                                  Conclusions                   In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, our data suggest that HCQ does not prevent severe outcomes or improve clinical scores. However, our conclusions are limited by a relatively small sample size, and larger randomized controlled trials or pooled analyses are needed.

Favipiravir versus other antiviral or standard of care for COVID-19 treatment: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis	https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12985-020-01412-z	24/09/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12985-020-01412-z	1743-422X	1743422X	VIROLOGY JOURNAL	A3	1.091	88	4.9	 Abstract  Background The COVID-19 causing coronavirus is an enveloped RNA virus that utilizes an enzyme RNA dependent RNA polymerase for its replication. Favipiravir (FVP) triphosphate, a purine nucleoside analog, inhibits that enzyme. We have conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis on efficacy and safety of the drug FVP as a treatment for COVID-19.  Methods Databases like Pubmed, Pubmed Central, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, preprint sites, and clinicaltirals.gov were searched. The studies with the standard of care (SOC) and FVP as a treatment drug were considered as the treatment group and the SOC with other antivirals and supportive care as the control group. Quantitative synthesis was done using RevMan 5.4. Clinical improvement, negative conversion of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), adverse effects, and oxygen requirements were studied.  Results We identified a total of 1798 studies after searching the electronic databases. Nine in the qualitative studies and four studies in the quantitative synthesis met the criteria. There was a significant clinical improvement in the FVP group on the 14th day compared to the control group (RR 1.29, 1.08–1.54). Clinical deterioration rates were less likely in the FVP group though statistically not significant (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.30–1.14) at the endpoint of study (7–15 days). The meta-analysis showed no significant differences between the two groups on viral clearance (day 14: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.84–1.33), non-invasive ventilation or oxygen requirement (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.42–1.39), and adverse effects (OR 0.69, 0.13–3.57). There are 31 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) registered in different parts of the world focusing FVP for COVID-19 treatment.  Conclusion There is a significant clinical and radiological improvement following treatment with FVP in comparison to the standard of care with no significant differences on viral clearance, oxygen support requirement and side effect profiles.

Despite extensive scientific research globally including repurposing of several existing drugs, there is no effective or proven therapy for this enigmatic disease which is still largely managed empirically This systematic review evaluated the role of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of COVID-19 infection and was conducted using Cochrane methodology for systematic reviews of interventional studies including risk of bias assessment and grading of the quality of evidence. Only prospective clinical trials randomly assigning COVID-19 patients to HCQ plus standard of care therapy (test arm) versus placebo/standard of care (control arm) were included. Data were pooled using the random-effects model and expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 10,492 patients from 19 randomised controlled trials were included. The use of HCQ was not associated with higher rates of clinical improvement (RR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.96-1.03, p = 0.79) or reduction in all-cause mortality by Day14 (RR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.97-1.19, p = 0.19) or Day28 (RR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.99-1.19, p = 0.09) compared to placebo/standard of care. There was no significant difference in serious adverse events between the two arms (RR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.85-1.19, p = 0.95). There is low-to-moderate certainty evidence that HCQ therapy is generally safe but does not reduce mortality or enhance recovery in patients with COVID-19 infection.	32446698	Gastroenterology	1528-0012	10.1053/j.gastro.2020.05.053

Intravenous methylprednisolone pulse as a treatment for hospitalised severe COVID-19 patients: results from a randomised controlled clinical trial	https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.02808-2020	17/09/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1183/13993003.02808-2020	0903-1936	09031936	THE EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL	A1	4.336	255	9.39	  Introduction There are no determined treatment agents for severe COVID-19. It is suggested that methylprednisolone, as an immunosuppressive treatment, can reduce the inflammation of the respiratory system in COVID-19 patients.  Methods We conducted a single-blind, randomised controlled clinical trial involving severe hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 at the early pulmonary phase of the illness in Iran. The patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio by the block randomisation method to receive standard care with methylprednisolone pulse (intravenous injection, 250 mg·day −1 for 3 days) or standard care alone. The study end-point was the time of clinical improvement or death, whichever came first. Primary and safety analysis was done in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population.  Results 68 eligible patients underwent randomisation (34 patients in each group) from April 20, 2020 to June 20, 2020. In the standard care group, six patients received corticosteroids by the attending physician before the treatment and were excluded from the overall analysis. The percentage of improved patients was higher in the methylprednisolone group than in the standard care group (94.1%  versus 57.1%) and the mortality rate was significantly lower in the methylprednisolone group (5.9%  versus 42.9%; p&lt;0.001). We demonstrated that patients in the methylprednisolone group had a significantly increased survival time compared with patients in the standard care group (log-rank test: p&lt;0.001; hazard ratio 0.293, 95% CI 0.154–0.556). Two patients (5.8%) in the methylprednisolone group and two patients (7.1%) in the standard care group showed severe adverse events between initiation of treatment and the end of the study.  Conclusions Our results suggest that methylprednisolone pulse could be an efficient therapeutic agent for hospitalised severe COVID-19 patients at the pulmonary phase.

Treatment of COVID-19 Patients with Prolonged Post-Symptomatic Viral Shedding with Leflunomide -- a Single-Center, Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial	https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1417	21/09/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1093/cid/ciaa1417	1058-4838	10584838	CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES	A1	4.394	353	8.72	 Abstract                                   Background                   We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of leflunomide, an approved dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor, to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with prolonged postsymptomatic viral shedding.                                                  Methods                   We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients with prolonged polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either leflunomide (50 mg every 12 hours, 3 consecutive times, orally; then 20 mg once daily for 8 days), in addition to nebulized interferon alpha 2a (IFN-α-2a, 3 million IU each time, twice daily for 10 days), or nebulized IFN-α-2a alone for 10 days. The primary endpoint was the duration of viral shedding.                                                  Results                   A total of 50 COVID-19 patients with prolonged PCR positivity were randomized into 2 groups: 26 were assigned to the leflunomide plus IFN-α-2a group, and 24 were assigned to the interferon-alone group. Treatment with leflunomide was not associated with a difference from the interferon-alone group in the duration of viral shedding (hazard ratio for negative reverse-transcription PCR, 0.70 [95% confidence interval, .391–1.256]; P = .186). In addition, the patients given leflunomide did not have a substantially shorter length of hospital stay than patients treated with interferon alone, with median durations of 29.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 19.3–47.3) days and 33.0 (IQR, 29.3–42.8) days, respectively (P = .170). Two leflunomide recipients were unable to complete the full 10-day course of administration due to adverse events.                                                  Conclusions                   In COVID-19 patients with prolonged PCR positivity, no benefit in terms of the duration of viral shedding was observed with the combined treatment of leflunomide and IFN-α-2a beyond IFN-α-2a alone.

A prospective, randomized, open-label trial of early versus late favipiravir in hospitalized patients with COVID-19	https://aac.asm.org/content/early/2020/09/16/AAC.01897-20	21/09/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://aac.asm.org/content/early/2020/09/16/AAC.01897-20	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Favipiravir']	['Favipiravir']	Favipiravir is an oral broad-spectrum inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is approved for treatment of influenza in Japan. We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial of favipiravir for the treatment of COVID-19 at 25 hospitals across Japan. Eligible patients were adolescents and adults admitted with COVID-19 who were asymptomatic or mildly ill and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to early or late favipiravir therapy (in the latter case, the same regimen starting on day 6 instead of day 1). The primary endpoint was viral clearance by day 6. The secondary endpoint was change in viral load by day 6. Exploratory endpoints included time to defervescence and resolution of symptoms. Eighty-nine patients were enrolled, of whom 69 were virologically evaluable. Viral clearance occurred within 6 days in 66.7% and 56.1% of the early and late treatment groups (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.76 to 2.62). Of 30 patients who had a fever (≥37.5°C) on day 1, times to defervescence were 2.1 days and 3.2 days in the early and late treatment groups (aHR, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.81 to 4.35). During therapy, 84.1% developed transient hyperuricemia. Favipiravir did not significantly improve viral clearance as measured by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) by day 6 but was associated with numerical reduction in time to defervescence. Neither disease progression nor death occurred in any of the patients in either treatment group during the 28-day participation.

Antimicrobial mouthwashes (gargling) and nasal sprays administered to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection to improve patient outcomes and to protect healthcare workers treating them (Review)	https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013627.pub2/full	16/09/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1002/14651858.CD013627.pub2/full	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Enxaguantes bucais', 'Spray nasal']	['Mouthwashes', 'Nose spray']	We found no completed studies to include in this review. We identified three ongoing studies (including two RCTs), which aim to enrol nearly 700 participants. The interventions included in these trials are povidone iodine, nitric oxide and GLS-1200 oral spray (the constituent of this spray is unclear and may not be antimicrobial in nature).   AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no studies for inclusion in this review. This is not surprising given the relatively recent emergence of COVID-19 infection. It is promising that the question posed in this review is being addressed by two RCTs and a non-randomised study. We are concerned that only one of the ongoing studies specifically states that it will evaluate adverse events and it is not clear if this will include changes in the sense of smell or to the oral and nasal microbiota, and any consequences thereof. Very few interventions have large and dramatic effect sizes. If a positive treatment effect is demonstrated when studies are available for inclusion in this review, it may not be large. In these circumstances in particular, where those receiving the intervention are otherwise fit and well, it may be a challenge to weigh up the benefits against the harms if the latter are of uncertain frequency and severity.	32936949	The Cochrane database of systematic reviews	1469-493X	10.1002/14651858.CD013626.pub2

Interventions for treatment of COVID-19: a protocol for a living systematic review with network meta-analysis including individual patient data (The LIVING Project)	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-020-01371-0	09/05/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1186/s13643-020-01371-0	2046-4053	20464053	SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS	A2	0.947	68	3.24	 Abstract                  Background                 COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading virus infection that has quickly caused extensive burden to individual, families, countries, and the globe. No intervention has yet been proven effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Some randomized clinical trials assessing the effects of different drugs have been published, and more are currently underway. There is an urgent need for a living, dynamic systematic review that continuously evaluates the beneficial and harmful effects of all available interventions for COVID-19.                                Methods/design                 We will conduct a living systematic review based on searches of major medical databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL) and clinical trial registries from their inception onwards to identify relevant randomized clinical trials. We will update the literature search once a week to continuously assess if new evidence is available. Two review authors will independently extract data and perform risk of bias assessment. We will include randomized clinical trials comparing any intervention for the treatment of COVID-19 (e.g., pharmacological interventions, fluid therapy, invasive or noninvasive ventilation, or similar interventions) with any comparator (e.g., an “active” comparator, standard care, placebo, no intervention, or “active placebo”) for participants in all age groups with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes will be admission to intensive care, mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, quality of life, and non-serious adverse events. The living systematic review will include aggregate data meta-analyses, Trial Sequential Analyses, network meta-analysis, and individual patient data meta-analyses. Risk of bias will be assessed with domains, an eight-step procedure will be used to assess if the thresholds for clinical significance are crossed, and the certainty of the evidence will be assessed by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE).                                Discussion                 COVID-19 has become a pandemic with substantial mortality. A living systematic review evaluating the beneficial and harmful effects of pharmacological and other interventions is urgently needed. This review will continuously inform best practice in treatment and clinical research of this highly prevalent disease.

Methods Clinical data on COVID-19 inpatients in Zengdu Hospital from January 27 to March 11, 2020 were collected; this is a community hospital in an area surrounding Wuhan and supported by volunteer doctors. All hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included in this study. The epidemiological findings, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiologic manifestations, and clinical outcomes of these patients were analyzed. The patients were followed up for clinical outcomes until March 22, 2020. Severe COVID-19 cases include severe and critical cases diagnosed according to the seventh edition of China’s COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines. Severe and critical COVID-19 cases were diagnosed according to the seventh edition of China’s COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines.  Results All hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 276 (median age: 51.0 years), were enrolled, including 262 non-severe and 14 severe patients. The proportion of patients aged over 60 years was higher in the severe group (78.6%) than in the non-severe group (18.7%,  p &lt; 0.01). Approximately a quarter of the patients (24.6%) had at least one comorbidity, such as hypertension, diabetes, or cancer, and the proportion of patients with comorbidities was higher in the severe group (85.7%) than in the non-severe group (21.4%,  p &lt; 0.01). Common symptoms included fever (82.2% [227/276]) and cough (78.0% [218/276]). 38.4% (106/276) of the patients had a fever at the time of admission. Most patients (94.9% [204/276]) were cured and discharged; 3.6% (10/276) deteriorated to a critical condition and were transferred to another hospital. The median COVID-19 treatment duration and hospital stay were 14.0 and 18.0 days, respectively.  Conclusions Most of the COVID-19 patients in Zengdu had mild disease. Older patients with underlying diseases were at a higher risk of progression to severe disease. The length of hospital-stay and antiviral treatment duration for COVID-19 were slightly longer than those in Wuhan. This work will contribute toward an understanding of COVID-19 characteristics in the areas around the core COVID-19 outbreak region and serve as a reference for decision-making for epidemic prevention and control in similar areas.

To assess the efficacy and safety of Triazavirin therapy for COVID-19, we conducted a randomized, double-blinded controlled trial involving hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19. Participants were enrolled from ten sites, and were randomized into two arms of the study with a ratio of 1:1. Patients were treated with Triazavirin 250 mg versus a placebo three or four times a day for 7 d. The primary outcome was set as the time to clinical improvement, defined as normalization of body temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, cough, and absorption of pulmonary infection by chest computed tomography (CT) until 28 d after randomization. Secondary outcomes included individual components of the primary outcome, the mean time and proportion of inflammatory absorption in the lung, and the conversion rate to a repeated negative SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test of throat swab sampling. Concomitant therapeutic treatments, adverse events, and serious adverse events were recorded. Our study was halted after the recruitment of 52 patients, since the number of new infections in the participating hospitals decreased greatly.

Zinc sulfate in combination with a zinc ionophore may improve outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients	https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jmm/10.1099/jmm.0.001250	15/09/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jmm/10.1099/jmm.0.001250	0022-2615	00222615	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY	B2	0.680	122	2.89	                    Introduction. COVID-19 has rapidly emerged as a pandemic infection that has caused significant mortality and economic losses. Potential therapies and prophylaxis against COVID-19 are urgently needed to combat this novel infection. As a result of  in vitro evidence suggesting zinc sulphate may be efficacious against COVID-19, our hospitals began using zinc sulphate as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.                                   Aim. To compare outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients ordered to receive hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin plus zinc sulphate versus hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone.                                   Methodology. This was a retrospective observational study. Data was collected from medical records for all patients with admission dates ranging from 2 March 2020 through to 11 April 2020. Initial clinical characteristics on presentation, medications given during the hospitalization, and hospital outcomes were recorded. The study included patients admitted to any of four acute care NYU Langone Health Hospitals in New York City. Patients included were admitted to the hospital with at least one positive COVID-19 test and had completed their hospitalization. Patients were excluded from the study if they were never admitted to the hospital or if there was an order for other investigational therapies for COVID-19.                                   Results. Patients taking zinc sulphate in addition to hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin ( n=411) and patients taking hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin alone ( n=521) did not differ in age, race, sex, tobacco use or relevant comorbidities. The addition of zinc sulphate did not impact the length of hospitalization, duration of ventilation or intensive care unit (ICU) duration. In univariate analyses, zinc sulphate increased the frequency of patients being discharged home, and decreased the need for ventilation, admission to the ICU and mortality or transfer to hospice for patients who were never admitted to the ICU. After adjusting for the time at which zinc sulphate was added to our protocol, an increased frequency of being discharged home (OR 1.53, 95 % CI 1.12–2.09) and reduction in mortality or transfer to hospice among patients who did not require ICU level of care remained significant (OR 0.449, 95 % CI 0.271–0.744).                                   Conclusion. This study provides the first  in vivo evidence that zinc sulphate may play a role in therapeutic management for COVID-19.

Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin as a Treatment of COVID-19: Electrocardiogram Variability	https://doi.org/10.37616/2212-5043.1088	20/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.37616/2212-5043.1088	2212-5043	22125043	Journal of the Saudi Heart Association	-	0.194	18	0.59	-	['Azitromicina', 'Hidroxicloroquina']	['Azithromycin', 'Hydroxychloroquine']	During the COVID-19 pandemic, the effectiveness of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin is widely discussed. This treatment can cause many severe cardiac side effects that makes us discuss its utility. The aim of this study is to describe the cardiovascular effect of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin by analyzing surface ECG in patients with COVID-19. This observational cohort study included Moroccan patients with COVID-19 diagnosis and were hospitalized in Cheikh Khalifa International University Hospital, Casablanca, Morocco between March 26 and April 20, 2020. Patients were treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of at least ten days. We were interested in the effects of this combination on the electrocardiogram. A total of 118 eligible patients were enrolled in the study. QT interval prolongation was observed in 19% of patients under the treatment. Only 5 patients required discontinuation of treatment. The factors associated with QT prolongation are male gender (P value 0,043), age over 68 years (P value 0,09), cardiovascular comorbidity (P value 0,013), tisdale score ≥11 (P value < 0,001), and a severe form of COVID-19 (P value < 0,001). First degree atrioventricular block was observed in 2 patients. No serious rhythm or conduction disorders were observed in this study. QT prolongation is a real risk with the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. In the current context, it is necessary to select patients at high risk of severe rhythm disturbances that require closer ECG monitoring. Treatment should be discontinued if there are alarming signs such as QTc prolongation beyond 550 ms and the development of ventricular extrasystole or torsade de pointe.	33299775	Journal of the Saudi Heart Association	1016-7315	10.37616/2212-5043.1088

The aim of the present study was to assess the safety and potential benefits of human recombinant C1 esterase inhibitor (conestat alfa), a complement, contact activation and kallikrein-kinin system regulator, in severe COVID-19. Patients with evidence of progressive disease after 24 h including an oxygen saturation <93% at rest in ambient air were included at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland in April 2020. Conestat alfa was administered by intravenous injections of 8400 IU followed by 3 additional doses of 4200 IU in 12-h intervals. Five patients (age range, 53-85 years; one woman) with severe COVID-19 pneumonia (11-39% lung involvement on computed tomography scan of the chest) were treated a median of 1 day (range 1-7 days) after admission. Treatment was well-tolerated. Immediate defervescence occurred, and inflammatory markers and oxygen supplementation decreased or stabilized in 4 patients (e.g., median C-reactive protein 203 (range 31-235) mg/L before vs. 32 (12-72) mg/L on day 5). Only one patient required mechanical ventilation. All patients recovered. C1INH concentrations were elevated before conestat alfa treatment. Levels of complement activation products declined after treatment. Viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs declined in 4 patients. In this uncontrolled case series, targeting multiple inflammatory cascades by conestat alfa was safe and associated with clinical improvements in the majority of severe COVID-19 patients. Controlled clinical trials are needed to assess its safety and efficacy in preventing disease progression.	32922409	Frontiers in immunology	1664-3224	10.3389/fimmu.2020.02072

A retrospective, single-center study was conducted. The median age of the 132 HCWs with COVID-19 was 32 years, with 92 (69.7%) being females. There were 47 (35.6%) doctors, 72 (54.6%) nurses, and 13 (9.9%) other HCWs. Ten of the 132 patients (7.6%) had underlying diseases. The most common symptoms of illness onset were fever (70, 53.0%), cough (66, 50.0%), and fatigue (58, 43.9%). All patients were categorized into mild or moderate COVID-19 type on admission to hospital, and five (3.8%) progressed to the severe COVID-19 type. Sixty-six HCWs patients were included in both the early and later discharged group. In the logistic analysis, the later discharged patients had a longer time for illness onset to hospital admission (per 1 day; OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.18; p = .006), a higher proportion of >3 onset symptoms clustering (OR, 3.11; 95% CI, 1.27-7.62; p = .01), and a higher percentage of other HCWs (OR, 6.20; 95% CI, 1.49-25.80; p = .01). HCW patients were young female nurses with fewer comorbidities, and most were mild or moderate COVID-19 type.

Mandated Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination predicts flattened curves for the spread of COVID-19	https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/32/eabc1463	05/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/32/eabc1463	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Vacina BCG']	['BCG vaccine']	Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination may reduce the risk of a range of infectious diseases, and if so, it could protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we compared countries that mandated BCG vaccination until at least 2000 with countries that did not. To minimize any systematic effects of reporting biases, we analyzed the rate of the day-by-day increase in both confirmed cases (134 countries) and deaths (135 countries) in the first 30-day period of country-wise outbreaks. The 30-day window was adjusted to begin at the country-wise onset of the pandemic. Linear mixed models revealed a significant effect of mandated BCG policies on the growth rate of both cases and deaths after controlling for median age, gross domestic product per capita, population density, population size, net migration rate, and various cultural dimensions (e.g., individualism). Our analysis suggests that mandated BCG vaccination can be effective in the fight against COVID-19.	32923613	Science advances	2375-2548	10.1126/sciadv.abc1463
Correlation between immunity from BCG and the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19	https://doi.org/10.1186/s40794-020-00117-z	28/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1186/s40794-020-00117-z	2055-0936	20550936	Tropical Diseases, Travel Medicine and Vaccines	-	0.734	16	3.1	 Abstract  Background To investigate the association between parameters indicating immunity from BCG at country level (presence of BCG vaccination policy, BCG coverage, age-specific incidence of tuberculosis (TB)) and the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.  Methods Country-specific data for COVID-19 cases and deaths, demographic details, BCG coverage and policy, age-specific TB incidence and income level were obtained. The crude COVID-19 cases and deaths per 100,000 population were calculated and assessed against the parameters indicating immunity from BCG using linear regression analysis.  Results Univariate analysis identified higher income level of a country to be significantly associated with COVID-19 cases ( p &lt; 0.0001) and deaths ( p &lt; 0.0001) but not with its case fatality rate. The association between COVID-19 and TB was strongest for TB incidence in patients &gt; 65-years (Cases (r s = − 0.785, p = 0.0001)) and deaths (r s = − 0.647, p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified the higher income level of a country and not having a universal BCG vaccination policy to affect the COVID-19 cases. The deaths were inversely affected by the presence of BCG vaccination policy and coverage; and positively by the TB incidence in patients &gt; 65-years.  Conclusion Significant inverse correlations observed between cases and deaths of COVID-19 and BCG related parameters highlights immunity from BCG as a likely explanation for the variation in COVID-19 across countries.

For the prophylactics, the medical staff was prevented from pre-exposure prophylaxis (risk prevention of exposure to COVID-19 patients before using thymosin drugs) and postexposure prophylaxis (risk prevention of exposure to COVID-19 patients after using thymosin drugs). The effectiveness and safety of thymosin drugs were studied in the prevention and control of COVID-19 application, in real-world data research for the application of the drug for COVID- 19. In a similar exposure environment, compared to medical staffers who did not take preventive medicine, the use of thymosin drugs, before exposure and after exposure had an insignificant effect, and the adverse drug reaction (ADR) was increased, especially when thymosin drugs were used together with α-interferon.	32897543	Journal of medical virology	1096-9071	10.1002/jmv.26492

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors do not increase the risk of poor outcomes in COVID-19 disease. A multi-centre observational study	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0036933020951926	01/09/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1177/0036933020951926	0036-9330	00369330	Scottish Medical Journal	-	0.293	27	1.26	  Background and aims  Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of severe outcomes with COVID-19 disease. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used as a first line medication for the treatment of hypertension in the UK, although their use was suggested in early reports to increase the risk associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.   Methods  A prospective cohort study of hospitalised patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 was conducted across three hospital sites with patients identified on the 9th April 2020. Demographic and other baseline data were extracted from electronic case records, and patients grouped depending on ACE inhibitor usage or not. The 60-day all-cause mortality and need for intubation compared.   Results  Of the 173 patients identified, 88 (50.8%) had hypertension. Of these 27 (30.7%) used ACE inhibitors. We did not find significant differences in 60-day all-cause mortality, the requirement for invasive ventilation or length of stay between our patient cohorts after adjusting for covariates.   Conclusion  This study contributes to the growing evidence supporting the continued use of ACE inhibitors in COVID-19 disease, although adequately powered randomised controlled trials will be needed to confirm effects.

COVID-19: age, Interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and lymphocytes as key clues from a multicentre retrospective study	https://doi.org/10.1186/s12979-020-00194-w	14/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1186/s12979-020-00194-w	1742-4933	17424933	IMMUNITY & AGEING	A2	1.697	50	7.3	 Abstract  Background The SARS-CoV-2 infection has widely spread to become the greatest public health challenge to date, the COVID-19 pandemic. Different fatality rates among countries are probably due to non-standardized records being carried out by local health authorities. The Spanish case-fatality rate is 11.22%, far higher than those reported in Asia or by other European countries. A multicentre retrospective study of demographic, clinical, laboratory and immunological features of 584 Spanish COVID-19 hospitalized patients and their outcomes was performed. The use of renin-angiotensin system blockers was also analysed as a risk factor.  Results In this study, 27.4% of cases presented a mild course, 42.1% a moderate one and for 30.5% of cases, the course was severe. Ages ranged from 18 to 98 (average 63). Almost 60 % (59.8%) of patients were male. Interleukin 6 was higher as severity increased. On the other hand, CD8 lymphocyte count was significantly lower as severity grew and subpopulations CD4, CD8, CD19, and NK showed concordant lowering trends. Severity-related natural killer percent descents were evidenced just within aged cases. A significant severity-related decrease of CD4 lymphocytes was found in males. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was associated with a better prognosis. The angiotensin II receptor blocker use was associated with a more severe course.  Conclusions Age and age-related comorbidities, such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension or diabetes, determined more frequent severe forms of the disease in this study than in previous literature cohorts. Our cases are older than those so far reported and the clinical course of the disease is found to be impaired by age. Immunosenescence might be therefore a suitable explanation for the hampering of immune system effectors. The adaptive immunity would become exhausted and a strong but ineffective and almost deleterious innate response would account for COVID-19 severity. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors used by hypertensive patients have a protective effect in regards to COVID-19 severity in our series. Conversely, patients on angiotensin II receptor blockers showed a severer disease.

Chloroquine (CQ) and its analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were found to be efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 when investigated in preliminary in vitro experiments. Reports of success in early clinical studies were widely publicised by news outlets, politicians and on social media. These results led several countries to approve the use of these drugs for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Despite having reasonable safety profiles in the treatment of malaria and certain autoimmune conditions, both drugs are known to have potential cardiotoxic side effects. There is a high incidence of myocardial injury and arrhythmia reported with COVID-19 infection, and as such this population may be more susceptible to this side-effect profile. Studies to date have now demonstrated that in patients with COVID-19, these drugs are associated with significant QTc prolongation, as well as reports of ventricular arrhythmias. Furthermore, subsequent studies have failed to demonstrate clinical benefit from either drug. Indeed, clinical trials have also been stopped early due to safety concerns over HCQ. There is an urgent need for credible solutions to the global pandemic, but we argue that in the absence of high-quality evidence, there needs to be greater caution over the routine use or authorisation of drugs for which efficacy and safety is unproven.	32817375	Open heart	2053-3624	10.1136/openhrt-2020-001362
Immunomodulatory-based therapy as a potential promising treatment strategy against severe COVID-19 patients: A systematic review	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106942	29/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106942	1567-5769	15675769	INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY (PRINT)	A2	1.059	119	5.61	-	['Agentes anti-interleucinas', 'Esteroides', 'Hidroxicloroquina', 'Imunoglobulina', 'Plasma convalescente', 'Terapia celular', 'Terapia de purificação do sangue']	['Anti-Interleukin Agents', 'Steroidal', 'Hydroxychloroquine', 'Immunoglobulin', 'Convalescent Plasma', 'Cell Therapy', 'Blood Purification Therapy']	The global panic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an urgent requirement for effective therapy. COVID-19 infection, especially in severely ill patients, is likely to be associated with immune dysregulation, prompting the development of novel treatment approaches. Therefore, this systematic review was designed to assess the available data regarding the efficacy of the immunomodulatory drugs used to manage COVID-19. A systematic literature search was carried out up to May 27, 2020, in four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase) and also Clinicaltrials.gov. Sixty-six publications and 111 clinical trials were recognized as eligible, reporting the efficacy of the immunomodulatory agents, including corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, passive and cytokine-targeted therapies, mesenchymal stem cells, and blood-purification therapy, in COVID-19 patients. The data were found to be heterogeneous, and the clinical trials were yet to post any findings. Medicines were found to regulate the immune system by boosting the innate responses or suppressing the inflammatory reactions. Passive and cytokine-targeted therapies and mesenchymal stem cells were mostly safe and could regulate the disease much better. These studies underscored the significance of severity profiling in COVID-19 patients, along with appropriate timing, duration, and dosage of the therapies. Therefore, this review indicates that immunomodulatory therapies are potentially effective for COVID-19 and provides comprehensive information for clinicians to fight this outbreak. However, there is no consensus on the optimal therapy for COVID-19, reflecting that the immunomodulatory therapies still warrant further investigations.	32896750	International immunopharmacology	1878-1705	10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106942

Methods                   A total of 1514 severe and 249 critical hospitalized COVID-19 patients from 2 medical centers in Wuhan, China. Multivariable Cox models, Cox model with time-varying exposure and propensity score analysis (inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighting [IPTW] and propensity score matching [PSM]) were used to estimate the association of corticosteroid use with risk of in-hospital mortality in severe and critical cases.                                                  Results                   Corticosteroids were administered in 531 (35.1%) severe and 159 (63.9%) critical patients. Compared to the non-corticosteroid group, systemic corticosteroid use was not associated with beneficial effect in reducing in-hospital mortality in either severe cases (HR = 1.77; 95% CI, 1.08-2.89; P = 0.023), or critical cases (HR = 2.07; 95% CI, 1.08–3.98; P = 0.028). Findings were similar in time-varying Cox analysis. For patients with severe COVID-19 at admission, corticosteroid use was not associated with improved or harmful outcome in either PSM or IPTW analysis. For critical COVID-19 patients at admission, results were consistent with multivariable Cox model analysis.                                                  Conclusion                   Corticosteroid use was not associated with beneficial effect in reducing in-hospital mortality for severe or critical cases in Wuhan. Absence of the beneficial effect in our study in contrast to that observed in the RECOVERY clinical trial may be due to biases in observational data, in particular prescription by indication bias, differences in clinical characteristics of patients, choice of corticosteroid used, timing of initiation of treatment, and duration of treatment.

Los agentes terapéuticos evaluados incluyeron cloroquina/hidroxicloroquina, lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab, oseltamivir, interferón, atazanavir y plasma anti-SARS-CoV-2. La identificación de evidencia incluyó la revisión de las bases electrónicas PubMed y Cochrane Library. Adicionalmente, se realizó una búsqueda manual en las páginas web de grupos dedicados a la investigación y educación en salud, así como, en las principales sociedades o instituciones especializadas, como la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) y los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC, por sus siglas en inglés). Asimismo, para disminuir el sesgo de publicación, se buscó en las páginas web www.clinicaltrials.gov y http://apps.who.int/trialsearch, para identificar ensayos clínicos en desarrollo o que no hayan sido publicados aún. Finalmente, se consideró extraer información con una estrategia de «bola de nieve» mediante la revisión de las listas de referencias de las revisiones sistemáticas, estudios primarios y revisiones narrativas que sean de relevancia. A la fecha de la última revisión (27 de marzo de 2020), no se dispone de evidencia para recomendar un medicamento específico para el tratamiento de pacientes con COVID-19. Se necesita de mayor evidencia, preferentemente ensayos clínicos de buena calidad, para la toma de decisiones terapéuticas contra el SARS-CoV-2.

Patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 were randomly divided into the BRH group or the control group at a 2:1 ratio. Routine treatment according to China's Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan was performed in both groups, whereas patients in the BRH group were additionally given oral BRH (32 mg t.i.d.) for 14 consecutive days. The efficacy and safety of BRH were evaluated. A total of 18 patients with moderate COVID-19 were randomized into the BRH group (n = 12) or the control group (n = 6). There were suggestions of BRH advantage over placebo in improved chest computed tomography, need for oxygen therapy, and discharge rate within 20 days. However, none of these findings were statistically significant. BRH tablets may potentially have a beneficial effect in patients with COVID-19, especially for those with lung or hepatic injury. A further definitive large-scale clinical trial is feasible and necessary.	32881359	Clinical and translational science	1752-8062	10.1111/cts.12881

The potential of low molecular weight heparin to mitigate cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 patients: a retrospective cohort study	https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cts.12880	03/09/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1111/cts.12880	1752-8054	17528054	Clinical and Translational Science	-	1.162	48	4.64	-	['Heparina']	['Heparin']	On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared its assessment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic. However, specific anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) drugs are still under development, and patients are managed by multiple complementary treatments. We performed a retrospective analysis to compare and evaluate the effect of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) treatment on disease progression. For this purpose, the clinical records and laboratory indicators were extracted from electronic medical records of 42 patients with COVID-19 (21 of whom were treated with LMWH, and 21 without LMWH) hospitalized (Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology) from February 1 to March 15, 2020. Changes in the percentage of lymphocytes before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (P = 0.011). Likewise, changes in the levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products in the LMWH group before and after treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (P = 0.035). Remarkably, IL-6 levels were significantly reduced after LMWH treatment (P = 0.006), indicating that, besides other beneficial properties, LMWH may exert an anti-inflammatory effect and attenuate in part the "cytokine storm" induced by the virus. Our results support the use of LMWH as a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of COVID-19, paving the way for a subsequent well-controlled clinical study.	32881340	Clinical and translational science	1752-8062	10.1111/cts.12880

Empiric therapeutic anticoagulation and mortality in critically ill patients with respiratory failure from SARS-CoV-2: A retrospective cohort study	https://accp1.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcph.1749	03/09/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1002/jcph.1749	0091-2700	00912700	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY	A3	0.687	121	2.9	-	['Heparina']	['Heparin']	The pathophysiology of respiratory failure associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains under investigation. One hypothesis is that progressive endothelial damage from the virus leads to microvascular thrombosis. It is uncertain if empiric therapeutic anticoagulation provides benefit over standard deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2. A retrospective cohort study was performed to evaluate adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit at 3 hospitals with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-associated respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare patients who were initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation prior to the time of intubation and those receiving standard DVT prophylaxis doses. The primary outcome was the difference in the 28-day mortality of patients between the 2 groups. Twenty-eight-day mortality did not differ between groups, occurring in 26.1% of patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation and 29.5% of those who received a prophylactic dose only (hazard ratio, 0.52; P = .055). There was no difference in 28-day mortality between groups in patients who were admitted with a serum D-dimer ≥ 2 µg/mL (hazard ratio, 0.67; P = .41). Empiric therapeutic anticoagulation in patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation for confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection does not improve 28-day mortality compared with standard DVT prophylaxis, even among those with elevated D-dimer levels.	32885463	Journal of clinical pharmacology	1552-4604	10.1002/jcph.1749

Evaluation of seventeen patients with COVID-19 pneumonia treated with anakinra according to HScore, SOFA, MuLBSTA and Brescia-COVID respiratory severity scale (BCRSS) scoring systems	https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26473	29/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1002/jmv.26473	0146-6615	01466615	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY (PRINT)	B1	2.656	137	14.76	-	['Anakinra']	['Anakinra']	COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting the whole world by increasing morbidity and mortality rates day by day. Treatment algorithms have been attempted as parallel to the increasing experience with COVID-19. In the pathogenesis of this virus pro-inflammatory cytokine storm has been called to have the main role. The right timing should be made for treatments. We proposed IL- 1 blocking by anakinra in seventeen COVID-19 patients at high risk of worsening. Patients were assessed according to HScore, SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score = SOFA), MuLBSTA Score (multilobular infiltration, hypo-lymphocytosis, bacterial coinfection, smoking history, hyper-tension, and age), Brescia-COVID respiratory severity scale (BCRSS). In our study, the mortality rate was 17.6%. Consequently, 1 (5.9%) patient was receiving low-flow oxygen supply, 3 (17.6%) patients needed no longer oxygen supply and 10 (58.8%) patients were discharged from the hospital. According to the results of our study in the manner of general evaluation; we found that SOFA, MuLBSTA, and BCRSS scores were one step ahead according to HScore being insufficient to determine early phases of the disease. In our opinion, the prominent factors that emphasize the use of anakinra could be listed as comorbidity, risk, or presence of secondary infection, ongoing malignant disease. However, the other factors that enhance the use of anakinra in the situation of viremia also could be sorted as no response to full dose antivirals, antiviral side effects, or no success to antiviral treatment.	32860431	Journal of medical virology	1096-9071	10.1002/jmv.26473

No report about convalescent plasma therapy in treating patients with prolonged positivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been published. In this study, we conducted a retrospective observational study in 27 patients with prolonged positivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the clinical benefit of convalescent plasma therapy were analyzed. qRT-PCR test of SARS-CoV-2 RNA turned negative (≤ 7 days) in a part of patients (early negative group, n = 15) after therapy, others (late negative group, n = 12) turned negative in more than 7 days. Pulmonary imaging improvement was confirmed in 7 patients in early negative group and 8 in late negative group after CP therapy. Viral load decreased in early negative group compared with late negative group at day 3, 5, 7 after implementing convalescent plasma therapy. Patients in early negative group had a shorter median length of hospital stay. In conclusion, convalescent plasma therapy might help eliminate virus and shorten length of hospital stay in patients with prolonged positivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.	32865701	Virologica Sinica	1995-820X	10.1007/s12250-020-00281-8

Moderate-to-severe QTc prolongation during therapy was defined as a QTc interval >470 ms in men or >480 ms in women. Patients were treated under strict cardiac supervision. A total of 105 adults were included [56% male; median (IQR) age 69 (57-79) years]. All patients received therapy with HCQ in combination with azithromycin (AZM), and 95 (90%) also with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). Concomitant medications classified as having risk of developing torsades de pointes (TdP) were simultaneously used in 81 patients (77%). Moderate-to-severe QTc prolongation was observed in 14 patients (13%), mostly at Days 3-5 from baseline, with 6 (6%) developing severe prolongation (>500 ms). There was no evidence of TdP arrhythmia or TdP-associated death. Adding LPV/r to HCQ+AZM did not significantly prolong the QTc interval. Multivariable Cox regression revealed that comedications with known risk of TdP (HR = 11.28, 95% CI 1.08-117.41), higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR) ratio (HR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.03-1.18 per unit increase) and higher serum hs-cardiac troponin I (HR = 4.09, 95% CI 1.36-12.2 per unit increase) were major contributors to moderate-to-severe QTc prolongation. In this closely screened and monitored cohort, no complications derived from QTc prolongation were observed during pharmacological therapy containing HCQ for COVID-19. Evidence of myocardial injury with elevated troponin and strong inflammatory response, specifically higher NLR, are conditions requiring careful QTc interval monitoring.	32853675	International journal of antimicrobial agents	1872-7913	10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106142

Treatment of severe COVID-19 with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells	https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13287-020-01875-5	18/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13287-020-01875-5	1757-6512	17576512	STEM CELL RESEARCH & THERAPY	A1	1.330	90	7.89	 Abstract  Background COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease. No therapeutics have yet been proven effective for treating severe COVID-19.  Objectives To determine whether human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell infusion may be effective and safe for the treatment of severe COVID-19.  Methods Patients with severe COVID-19 were randomly divided into 2 groups: the standard treatment group and the standard treatment plus hUC-MSC infusion group. The incidence of progression from severe to critical illness, 28-day mortality, clinical symptom improvement, time to clinical symptom improvement, hematologic indicators including C-reactive protein, lymphocyte number, and interleukin 6, and imaging changes were observed and compared between the two groups.  Measurements and main results The incidence of progression from severe to critical illness and the 28-day mortality rate were 0 in the hUC-MSC treatment group, while 4 patients in the control group deteriorated to critical condition and received invasive ventilation; 3 of them died, and the 28-day mortality rate was 10.34%. In the hUC-MSC treatment group, the time to clinical improvement was shorter than that in the control group. Clinical symptoms of weakness and fatigue, shortness of breath, and low oxygen saturation obviously improved beginning on the third day of stem cell infusion and reached a significant difference on day 7. CRP and IL-6 levels were significantly lower from day 3 of infusion, the time for the lymphocyte count to return to the normal range was significantly faster, and lung inflammation absorption was significantly shorter on CT imaging in the hUC-MSC group than in the control group.  Conclusions Intravenous transplantation of hUC-MSCs is a safe and effective method that can be considered a salvage and priority treatment option for severe COVID-19.

At the moment, the genomic structure, characteristics, and pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported. Based upon this information, several drugs including the directly acting antivirals have been proposed to treat people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This rapid review aims to describe the directly acting antivirals that have been examined for use in the management of COVID-19. Searches were conducted in three electronic databases, supplemented with a search on arXiv, bioRxiv, medRxiv, ChinaXiv, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry for studies examining the use of antivirals in COVID-19 to identify for case reports, case series, observational studies, and randomized controlled studies describing the use of antivirals in COVID-19. Data were extracted independently and presented narratively. A total of 98 studies were included, comprising of 38 published studies and 60 registered clinical trials. These drugs include the broad spectrum antivirals such as umifenovir, protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir as well as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, remdesivir, and favipiravir. Other drugs that have been used include the nucleosidase inhibitors and polymerase acidic endonuclease inhibitors which are currently approved for prevention of influenza infections. While some of the drugs appear promising in small case series and reports, more clinical trials currently in progress are required to provide higher quality evidence.	32849448	Frontiers in microbiology	1664-302X	10.3389/fmicb.2020.01857

The Association between Influenza and Pneumococcal Vaccinations and SARS-Cov-2 Infection: Data from the EPICOVID19 Web-Based Survey	https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/8/3/471	23/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/8/3/471	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Vacina influenza', 'Vacina pneumocócica']	['Influenza vaccine', 'Pneumococcal vaccine']	The present study aims to evaluate whether influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations are associated with positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) testing to detect SARS-CoV-2. Data from the Italian cross-sectional web-based survey (EPICOVID19), based on a self-selection sample of individuals aged ≥18, were considered. The probability of a positive SARS-CoV-2 NPS test result as a function of influenza or anti-pneumococcal vaccination was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression, stratifying analysis by age (<65 years, ≥65 years). From April 2020, 170,731 individuals aged <65 years and 28,097 ≥65 years filled out the EPICOVID19 questionnaire. Influenza and anti-pneumococcal vaccinations were received, respectively, by 16% and 2% of those <65 years, and by 53% and 13% of those ≥65 years. SARS-CoV-2 NPS testing was reported by 6680 participants. Anti-pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations were associated with a decreased probability of a SARS-CoV-2 NPS positive test in the younger participants (OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.41-0.91; OR = 0.85, 95%CI 0.74-0.98; respectively). A significantly lower probability of a positive test result was detected in the individuals ≥65 years who received anti-pneumococcal vaccination (OR = 0.56, 95%CI 0.33-0.95). These results need to be confirmed by further investigations, but they are relevant given the probable coexistence of influenza, bacterial infections, and COVID-19 over the coming autumn-winter season.	32842505	Vaccines	2076-393X	10.3390/vaccines8030471

In animal experiments, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) are reported to suppress the downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and they may inhibit the worsening of pathological conditions. We aimed to examine whether preceding use of ACEIs and ARBs affected the clinical manifestations and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. One hundred fifty-one consecutive patients (mean age 60 ± 19 years) with polymerase-chain-reaction proven severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who were admitted to six hospitals in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, were analyzed in this multicenter retrospective observational study. Among all COVID-19 patients, in the multiple regression analysis, older age (age ≥ 65 years) was significantly associated with the primary composite outcome (odds ratio (OR) 6.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.28-22.78, P < 0.001), which consisted of (i) in-hospital death, (ii) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, (iii) mechanical ventilation, including invasive and noninvasive methods, and (iv) admission to the intensive care unit. In COVID-19 patients with hypertension, preceding ACEI/ARB use was significantly associated with a lower occurrence of new-onset or worsening mental confusion (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.002-0.69, P = 0.02), which was defined by the confusion criterion, which included mild disorientation or hallucination with an estimation of medical history of mental status, after adjustment for age, sex, and diabetes. In conclusion, older age was a significant contributor to a worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients, and ACEIs/ARBs could be beneficial for the prevention of confusion in COVID-19 patients with hypertension.	32820236	Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension	1348-4214	10.1038/s41440-020-00535-8

A total of 247 adult patients (154 males, 93 females; mean age: 51.3 ± 14.2 years) hospitalized for COVID-19 as confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic and clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters were analyzed using various statistical modeling. Primary outcomes were defined as the need for intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, or occurrence of death. Of the patients, 48 were treated in the ICU with a high flow oxygen/noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV, n = 12) or mechanical ventilation (n = 36). Median length of ICU stay was 13 (range, 7-18) days. Mortality was seen in four of the ICU patients. Other patients were followed in the COVID-19 services for a median of 7 days. There was no significant correlation between the primary outcomes and use of ACEIs/ARBs (frequentist OR = 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29-2.34, p = 0.715 and Bayesian posterior median OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.31-2.02) and presence of hypertension (frequentist OR = 1.23, 95% CI 0.52-2.92, p = 0.631 and Bayesian posterior median OR = 1.25, 95% CI 0.58-2.60). Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and D-dimer levels were strongly associated with primary outcomes. In conclusion, the presence of hypertension and use of ACEIs/ARBs were not significantly associated with poor primary clinical outcomes; however, NLR and D-dimer levels were strong predictors of clinical worsening.	32839534	Journal of human hypertension	1476-5527	10.1038/s41371-020-00405-3

Ruxolitinib is a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor with potent anti-inflammatory properties. We report on a prospective, observational study in 34 patients with COVID-19 who received ruxolitinib on a compassionate-use protocol. Patients had severe pulmonary disease defined by pulmonary infiltrates on imaging and an oxygen saturation ≤ 93% in air and/or PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤ 300 mmHg. Median age was 80.5 years, and 85.3% had ≥ 2 comorbidities. Median exposure time to ruxolitinib was 13 days, median dose intensity was 20 mg/day. Overall survival by day 28 was 94.1%. Cumulative incidence of clinical improvement of ≥2 points in the ordinal scale was 82.4% (95% confidence interval, 71–93). Clinical improvement was not affected by low-flow versus high-flow oxygen support but was less frequent in patients with PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 200 mmHg. The most frequent adverse events were anemia, urinary tract infections, and thrombocytopenia. Improvement of inflammatory cytokine profile and activated lymphocyte subsets was observed at day 14. In this prospective cohort of aged and high-risk comorbidity patients with severe COVID-19, compassionate-use ruxolitinib was safe and was associated with improvement of pulmonary function and discharge home in 85.3%. Controlled clinical trials are necessary to establish efficacy of ruxolitinib in COVID-19.

In this prospective cohort of aged and high-risk comorbidity patients with severe COVID-19, compassionate-use ruxolitinib was safe and was associated with improvement of pulmonary function and discharge home in 85.3%. Controlled clinical trials are necessary to establish efficacy of ruxolitinib in COVID-19.	32814839	Leukemia	1476-5551	10.1038/s41375-020-01018-y

Prior Routine Use of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and Important Outcomes in Hospitalised Patients with COVID-19	https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/8/2586	10/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/8/2586	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais']	['Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs']	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection causes acute lung injury, resulting from aggressive inflammation initiated by viral replication. There has been much speculation about the potential role of non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which increase the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a binding target for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to enter the host cell, which could lead to poorer outcomes in COVID-19 disease. The aim of this study was to examine the association between routine use of NSAIDs and outcomes in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. This was a multicentre, observational study, with data collected from adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to eight UK hospitals. Of 1222 patients eligible to be included, 54 (4.4%) were routinely prescribed NSAIDs prior to admission. Univariate results suggested a modest protective effect from the use of NSAIDs, but in the multivariable analysis, there was no association between prior NSAID use and time to mortality (adjusted HR (aHR) = 0.89, 95% CI 0.52-1.53, 	32785086	Journal of clinical medicine	2077-0383	10.3390/jcm9082586

Effect of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors in Patients with COVID-19: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of 28,872 Patients	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11883-020-00880-6	24/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1007/s11883-020-00880-6	1523-3804	15233804	CURRENT ATHEROSCLEROSIS REPORTS	A4	1.284	79	5.21	 Abstract  Purpose of Review The role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, notably angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), in the COVID-19 pandemic has not been fully evaluated. With an increasing number of COVID-19 cases worldwide, it is imperative to better understand the impact of RAAS inhibitors in hypertensive COVID patients. PubMed, Embase and the pre-print database Medrxiv were searched, and studies with data on patients on ACEi/ARB with COVID-19 were included. Random effects models were used to estimate the pooled mean difference with 95% confidence interval using Open Meta[Analyst] software.  Recent Findings A total of 28,872 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The use of any RAAS inhibition for any conditions showed a trend to lower risk of death/critical events (OR 0.671, CI 0.435 to 1.034,  p = 0.071). Within the hypertensive cohort, however, there was a significant lower association with deaths (OR 0.664, CI 0.458 to 0.964,  p = 0.031) or the combination of death/critical outcomes (OR 0.670, CI 0.495 to 0.908,  p = 0.010). There was no significant association of critical/death outcomes within ACEi vs non-ACEi (OR 1.008, CI 0.822 to 1.235,  p = 0.941) and ARB vs non-ARB (OR 0.946, CI 0.735 to 1.218,  p = 0.668).  Summary This is the largest meta-analysis including critical events and mortality data on patients prescribed ACEi/ARB and found evidence of beneficial effects of chronic ACEi/ARB use especially in hypertensive cohort with COVID-19. As such, we would strongly encourage patients to continue with RAAS inhibitor pharmacotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This pandemic situation and magnitude of suffering have led to global effort to find out effective measures for discovery of new specific drugs and vaccines to combat this deadly disease. In addition to many initiatives to develop vaccines for protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, some of which are at various stages of clinical trials, researchers worldwide are currently using available conventional therapeutic drugs with the potential to combat the disease effectively in other viral infections and it is believed that these antiviral drugs could act as a promising immediate alternative. Remdesivir (RDV), a broad-spectrum anti-viral agent, initially developed for the treatment of Ebola virus (EBOV) and known to showed promising efficiency in in vitro and in vivo studies against SARS and MERS coronaviruses, is now being investigated against SARS-CoV-2. On May 1, 2020, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for RDV to treat COVID- 19 patients [2]. A number of multicentre clinical trials are on-going to check the safety and efficacy of RDV for the treatment of COVID-19. Results of published double blind, and placebo-controlled trial on RDV against SARS-CoV-2, showed that RDV administration led to faster clinical improvement in severe COVID-19 patients compared to placebo. This review highlights the available knowledge about RDV as a therapeutic drug for coronaviruses and its preclinical and clinical trials against COVID-19.	33596800	Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry	1875-5607	10.2174/1389557521666210217093004
Potential therapeutic application of mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-020-01866-6	14/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1186/s13287-020-01866-6	1757-6512	17576512	STEM CELL RESEARCH & THERAPY	A1	1.330	90	7.89	 Abstract  Background The outbreak of a new virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now become the main health concern all over the world. Since effective antiviral treatments have not been developed until now, SARS-CoV-2 is severely affecting countries and territories around the world.  Methods At the present review, articles in PubMed were searched with the following terms: mesenchymal stem cells, exosomes, coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2, either alone or in a combination form. The most relevant selected functions were mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes and SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  Results SARS-CoV-2 could damage pulmonary cells and induce secretion of different types of inflammatory cytokines. In the following, these cytokines trigger inflammation that damages the lungs and results in lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The main characteristic of ARDS is the onset of inflammation in pulmonary, hyaline formation, pulmonary fibrosis, and edema. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-Exo) are believed to have anti-inflammatory effects and immune-modulating capacity as well as the ability to induce tissue regeneration, suggesting a significant therapeutic opportunity that could be used to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia treatment. Besides, exosomes may serve as a biomarker, drug delivery system, and vaccine for the management of the patient with SARS-CoV-2.  Conclusion MSC-Exo may serve as a promising tool in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. However, further work needs to be carried out to confirm the efficacy of exosomes in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

We determined prevalence and predictors of empiric antibacterial therapy and community-onset bacterial coinfections in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.                                                  Methods                   A randomly sampled cohort of 1705 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in 38 Michigan hospitals between 3/13/2020 and 6/18/2020. Data were collected on early (within 2 days of hospitalization) empiric antibacterial therapy and community-onset bacterial coinfections (positive microbiologic test ≤3 days). Poisson generalized estimating equation models were used to assess predictors.                                                  Results                   Of 1705 patients with COVID-19, 56.6% were prescribed early empiric antibacterial therapy; 3.5% (59/1705) had a confirmed community-onset bacterial infection. Across hospitals, early empiric antibacterial use varied from 27% to 84%. Patients were more likely to receive early empiric antibacterial therapy if they were older (adjusted rate ratio [ARR]: 1.04 [1.00–1.08] per 10 years); had a lower body mass index (ARR: 0.99 [0.99–1.00] per kg/m2), more severe illness (eg, severe sepsis; ARR: 1.16 [1.07–1.27]), a lobar infiltrate (ARR: 1.21 [1.04–1.42]); or were admitted to a for-profit hospital (ARR: 1.30 [1.15–1.47]). Over time, COVID-19 test turnaround time (returned ≤1 day in March [54.2%, 461/850] vs April [85.2%, 628/737], P &amp;lt; .001) and empiric antibacterial use (ARR: 0.71 [0.63–0.81] April vs March) decreased.                                                  Conclusions                   The prevalence of confirmed community-onset bacterial coinfections was low. Despite this, half of patients received early empiric antibacterial therapy. Antibacterial use varied widely by hospital. Reducing COVID-19 test turnaround time and supporting stewardship could improve antibacterial use.

We consider whether altered dynamics of peripheral immune cells in the context of natalizumab treatment could worsen the cytokine storm syndrome associated with severe COVID-19. We discuss extended interval dosing as a risk-reduction strategy for multiple sclerosis patients on natalizumab, and the use of interleukin-6 inhibitors in such patients who contract COVID-19.

Targeting Endothelial Dysfunction in Eight Extreme-Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19 Using the Anti-Adrenomedullin Antibody Adrecizumab (HAM8101)	https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/8/1171	11/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/8/1171	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Adrecizumabe']	['Adrecizumab']	Recently, the stabilization of the endothelium has been explicitly identified as a therapeutic goal in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Adrecizumab (HAM8101) is a first-in-class humanized monoclonal anti-Adrenomedullin (anti-ADM) antibody, targeting the sepsis- and inflammation-based vascular and capillary leakage. Within a "treatment on a named-patient basis" approach, Adrecizumab was administered to eight extreme-critically ill COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patients received a single dose of Adrecizumab, which was administered between 1 and 3 days after the initiation of mechanical ventilation. The SOFA (median 12.5) and SAPS-II (median 39) scores clearly documented the population at highest risk. Moreover, six of the patients suffered from acute renal failure, of whom five needed renal replacement therapy. The length of follow-up ranged between 13 and 27 days. Following the Adrecizumab administration, one patient in the low-dose group died at day 4 due to fulminant pulmonary embolism, while four were in stable condition, and three were discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU). Within 12 days, the SOFA score, as well as the disease severity score (range 0-16, mirroring critical resources in the ICU, with higher scores indicating more severe illness), decreased in five out of the seven surviving patients (in all high-dose patients). The PaO2/FiO2 increased within 12 days, while the inflammatory parameters C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and interleukin-6 decreased. Importantly, the mortality was lower than expected and calculated by the SOFA score. In conclusion, in this preliminary uncontrolled case series of eight shock patients with life-threatening COVID-19 and ARDS, the administration of Adrecizumab was followed by a favorable outcome. Although the non-controlled design and the small sample size preclude any definitive statement about the potential efficacy of Adrecizumab in critically ill COVID-19 patients, the results of this case series are encouraging.	32796765	Biomolecules	2218-273X	10.3390/biom10081171
Finding the Best Antiviral Regimen for COVID-19: A Double-Center Retrospective Cohort Study of 207 Cases in Hunan, China	https://doi.org/10.1177/1559325820949740	14/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1177/1559325820949740	1559-3258	15593258	DOSE-RESPONSE	A2	0.453	41	2.52	  Objective:  To compare the efficacy of 3/4-drugs’ group with 1-drug’s or 2-drugs’ groups in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).   Methods:  We included 207 patients confirmed with COVID-19. We compared the viral clearance rate and discharge rate at day 7, 14, 21 and 28, and median time of viral clearance and length of hospitalization in patients treated with 3/4, 1 or 2 drugs.   Results:  The viral clearance rates of the 3/4-drugs group at day 7, 14 and 21 were significantly lower than those in the 1-drug’s or 2-drugs’ groups (P &lt; 0.05). The median viral clearance days in 3/4-drugs group (13.5 days) were longer than 1-drug’s or 2-drugs’ groups (both were 9 days) (P &lt; 0.001). The patients’ discharge rates in the 3/4-drugs group at day 14 and 21 were significantly lower than that in the 1-drug’s or 2 drugs’ group (P &lt; 0.05). The median length of hospitalization in the 3/4-drugs group was 17 days, which was significantly longer than 11 days in the 1-drug group and 13 days in the 2-drug group (P &lt; 0.05).   Conclusion:  The efficacy of 1 or 2 antiviral drugs was similar in COVID-19, and 3/4-drug regimens were not associated with clinical improvement. Corticosteroid treatment and more serious disease were also risk factors for viral clearance and patients’discharge.

These mediators are transcriptionally regulated by the JAK/STAT signaling pathways, which can be disabled by small molecules.METHODSWe treated a group of patients (n = 20) with baricitinib according to an off-label use of the drug. The study was designed as an observational, longitudinal trial and approved by the local ethics committee. The patients were treated with 4 mg baricitinib twice daily for 2 days, followed by 4 mg per day for the remaining 7 days. Changes in the immune phenotype and expression of phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) in blood cells were evaluated and correlated with serum-derived cytokine levels and antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2). In a single treated patient, we also evaluated the alteration of myeloid cell functional activity.RESULTSWe provide evidence that patients treated with baricitinib had a marked reduction in serum levels of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, a rapid recovery of circulating T and B cell frequencies, and increased antibody production against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, all of which were clinically associated with a reduction in the need for oxygen therapy and a progressive increase in the P/F (PaO2, oxygen partial pressure/FiO2, fraction of inspired oxygen) ratio.CONCLUSIONThese data suggest that baricitinib prevented the progression to a severe, extreme form of the viral disease by modulating the patients' immune landscape and that these changes were associated with a safer, more favorable clinical outcome for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT04438629.FUNDINGThis work was supported by the Fondazione Cariverona (ENACT Project) and the Fondazione TIM.	32809969	The Journal of clinical investigation	1558-8238	141772

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: two case reports	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10047-020-01203-x	12/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1007/s10047-020-01203-x	1434-7229	14347229	Journal of Artificial Organs	-	0.331	40	1.49	-	['Argatrobana', 'Heparina']	['Argatroban', 'Heparin']	Veno-venous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is increasingly used in Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients with the most severe forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Its use is associated with a significant hemostatic challenge, especially in COVID- 19 patients who have been demonstrated to otherwise present a COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. The systematic use of unfractionated heparin therapy to prevent circuit thrombosis is warranted during ECMO support. The clinical presentation and management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which is a rare but life-threatening complication of heparin therapy, has not been described in those patients yet. We report herein two cases of laboratory-confirmed HIT in COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS admitted to our intensive care unit for VV-ECMO support and the successful use of argatroban as an alternative therapy. We also provide a brief literature review of best evidence for managing such patients. The diagnosis and management of HIT is particularly challenging in COVID-19 patients receiving ECMO support. An increased awareness is warranted in those patients who already present a procoagulant state leading to higher rates of thrombotic events which can confuse the issues. Argatroban seems to be an appropriate and safe therapeutic option in COVID-19 patients with HIT while on VV-ECMO.	32789604	Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for Artificial Organs	1619-0904	10.1007/s10047-020-01203-x

Clinical Outcomes of Early Treatment With Doxycycline for 89 High-Risk COVID-19 Patients in Long-Term Care Facilities in New York	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32802622	11/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	PUBMED_ID:32802622	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Doxiciclina']	['Doxycycline']	Rationale Due to the cluster and associated comorbidities in residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs), COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality are significantly increased. Multiple therapeutic options, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZI), were tried initially to treat moderate to severe COVID-19 and high-risk patients in LTCFs, but they were abandoned due to unfavorable reports. As a less toxic option, we initiated treatment with doxycycline (DOXY) very early in the course of illness. DOXY has antiviral, cardioprotective, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties, but the efficacy of early intervention with DOXY in high-risk COVID-19 patients in LTCFs is unknown. Objective The goal of this retrospective study is to describe the clinical outcomes of high-risk COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe symptoms in LTCFs after early intervention with DOXY. Design Case-series analysis Setting LTCFs in New York Participants This observational study examines 89 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 18 to May 13, 2020. Exposure All patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 received DOXY and regular standard of care within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms. Additionally, four patients received meropenem, three patients received Zosyn, two patients received linezolid, and two patients received Bactrim DS. Four patients were on chronic ventilator support. No patients received any steroids or any other antiviral or immunomodulatory agents. The majority of the patients received zinc and calcium supplements as well. Main outcomes and measures Assessed measures were patients' characteristics, fever, shortness of breath (SOB), cough, oxygen saturation/pulse oximetry (POX), radiologic improvements, laboratory tests, DOXY side effects, hospital transfers, and death. Results Eighty-nine (89) high-risk patients, who developed a sudden onset of fever, cough, SOB, and hypoxia and were diagnosed with COVID-19, were treated with DOXY (100 mg PO or intravenous (IV) for seven days) and regular standard of care. Eighty-five percent (85%) of patients (n=76) demonstrated clinical recovery that is defined as resolution of fever (average 3.7 days, Coeff = -0.96, p = 0.0001), resolution of SOB (average 4.2 days), and improvement of POX: average 84% before treatment and average 95% after treatment (84.7 ± 7% vs. 95 ± 2.6%, p = 0.0001). Higher pre- and post-treatment POX is associated with lower mortality (oxygen saturation (Spo2) vs. Death, Coeff = -0.01, p = 0.023; post-Spo2 vs. Death, Coeff = -0.05, p = 0.0002). Within 10 days of symptom onset, 3% of patients (n=3) were transferred to hospital due to clinical deterioration and 11% of patients (n=10) died.

ARRHYTHMIA AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY	A1	2.471	113	5.0	-	['Lopinavir', 'Ritonavir']	['Lopinavir', 'Ritonavir']	Rationale Due to the cluster and associated comorbidities in residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs), COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality are significantly increased. Multiple therapeutic options, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZI), were tried initially to treat moderate to severe COVID-19 and high-risk patients in LTCFs, but they were abandoned due to unfavorable reports. As a less toxic option, we initiated treatment with doxycycline (DOXY) very early in the course of illness. DOXY has antiviral, cardioprotective, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties, but the efficacy of early intervention with DOXY in high-risk COVID-19 patients in LTCFs is unknown. Objective The goal of this retrospective study is to describe the clinical outcomes of high-risk COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe symptoms in LTCFs after early intervention with DOXY. Design Case-series analysis Setting LTCFs in New York Participants This observational study examines 89 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 18 to May 13, 2020. Exposure All patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 received DOXY and regular standard of care within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms. Additionally, four patients received meropenem, three patients received Zosyn, two patients received linezolid, and two patients received Bactrim DS. Four patients were on chronic ventilator support. No patients received any steroids or any other antiviral or immunomodulatory agents. The majority of the patients received zinc and calcium supplements as well. Main outcomes and measures Assessed measures were patients' characteristics, fever, shortness of breath (SOB), cough, oxygen saturation/pulse oximetry (POX), radiologic improvements, laboratory tests, DOXY side effects, hospital transfers, and death. Results Eighty-nine (89) high-risk patients, who developed a sudden onset of fever, cough, SOB, and hypoxia and were diagnosed with COVID-19, were treated with DOXY (100 mg PO or intravenous (IV) for seven days) and regular standard of care. Eighty-five percent (85%) of patients (n=76) demonstrated clinical recovery that is defined as resolution of fever (average 3.7 days, Coeff = -0.96, p = 0.0001), resolution of SOB (average 4.2 days), and improvement of POX: average 84% before treatment and average 95% after treatment (84.7 ± 7% vs. 95 ± 2.6%, p = 0.0001). Higher pre- and post-treatment POX is associated with lower mortality (oxygen saturation (Spo2) vs. Death, Coeff = -0.01, p = 0.023; post-Spo2 vs. Death, Coeff = -0.05, p = 0.0002). Within 10 days of symptom onset, 3% of patients (n=3) were transferred to hospital due to clinical deterioration and 11% of patients (n=10) died. The result was followed for 30 days from the onset of symptoms in each patient. Conclusion Early treatment with DOXY for high-risk patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infections in non-hospital settings, such as LTCFs, is associated with early clinical recovery, decreased hospitalization, and decreased mortality.	32809882	Circulation.

We compared the baseline characteristics and in‐hospital mortality between patients with hypertension taking RAS inhibitors (n=355) versus non‐RAS inhibitors (n=827). Of the 1182 patients with hypertension (median age 68 years, 49.1% male), 12/355 (3.4%) patients died in the RAS inhibitors group versus 95/827 (11.5%) patients in the non‐RAS inhibitors group (               P              &lt;0.0001).

Even though a suggestive pathophysiological link between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system and the virus has been proposed, its pathogenic role remains very difficult to be defined. Although COronaVIrus Disease-19 targets preferentially older people with high prevalence of hypertension and extensive use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitors, an independent role for hypertension and its therapies is not defined. In this article, we scrutinize evidence from the most representative available studies in which the potential role of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, specifically angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, was evaluated in the COronaVIrus Disease-19 disease course, with regard to severity of the disease and mortality. We conclude that at this time, the overall available evidence fails to support a pathogenetic speaks against any harmful role for of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitors in COronaVIrus Disease-19. Consequently, we conclude that treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitors should not be discontinued and, therefore, these therapies should not be interrupted.	32738257	International journal of cardiology	1874-1754	10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.07.041

But antiviral properties mechanisms are not well known, HCQ is a weak base that accumulates in lysosomes, modifies their pH, and interferes with some enzymes. In the lack of confirmed efficacy, the initial potential risk is not to expose patients to adverse effects. However, results from preliminary clinical studies have drawn inconclusive results regarding the efficacy of HCQ in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to several important weaknesses in research methodologies. Hypokalemia often occurs in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), possibly due to the particular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 with regard to Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The wide use of HCQ, even against medical advice, will show an impact on ongoing clinical trials. It is important that we can recruite COVID-19 patients in these research studies to generate appropriate data regarding drugs that show promising efficacy against COVID-19. Currently, only doctors should be allowed to prescribe HCQ, and treatment should be confined to hospital settings, with proper cardiac and therapeutic drug monitoring.

On admission, he had no dyspnea and his oxygen saturation (SpO₂) level was normal. Chest imaging revealed ground-glass opacities (GGO) distributed in both lung fields. Four days after admission, bilateral lung shadows worsened, with a slight reduction in SpO₂ levels. Short-term corticosteroid therapy was initiated, and SpO₂ and radiographic findings promptly improved without use of antiviral agents.

Extensive search for the Vaccine or effective treatment is going on while alarming infection and death toll is rising every day.&#x0D;Aim: The study will compare the effect of Ivermectin with Doxycycline and Hydoxychloroquine with Azythromicin on a selective group of COVID -19 positive patients.&#x0D;Method: This is a comparative study that included 400 patients of COVID 19 positive patient who were divided in to two groups. Group- A Received Ivermectin with Doxycycline and the other group- B received hydroxichloroquine(HCQ) with azithromycin.&#x0D;Result: Viral clearance is 132 ( 66%) on day 5 and 167( 83.5% ) on day 6. Among them 33(16.5%) remain PCR positive after 6th day of Ivermectin ingestion in Group A. Whereas there is154 ( 77.0%) viral clearance at 11th day and 163(81.5%) viral clearance at 12th day of Hydroxychloroquine ingestion in Group B. Among them 37 (18.5%) remain PCR positive after 12 day in group B. The P value is 0.000427 which is significant considering 5th day viral clearance of Ivermectin ingestion and 11th day of Hydroxychloroquine ingestion. But considering 6th day and 12th day the P-value is 0.59 which is not significant.&#x0D;Conclusion: It appears Ivermectin and Doxycycline is safeand effective combination drug therapy in COVID- 19infected patients but need further extensive study to find out the scope of application on other groups of patients.&#x0D;J Bangladesh Coll Phys Surg 2020; 38(0): 5-9	['Azitromicina', 'Doxiciclina', 'Hidroxicloroquina', 'Ivermectina']	['Azithromycin', 'Doxycycline', 'Hydroxychloroquine', 'Ivermectin']	-	-	-	-	-

Initial reports from the outbreak in Italy, China and the USA have provided anecdotal evidence of improved outcomes with the administration of anti-IL-6 agents, and large-scale trials evaluating these therapies are ongoing.  Study description In this retrospective case series, clinical outcomes and correlates of response to treatment with the IL-6 receptor antagonist sarilumab are described for 15 patients with COVID-19 from a single institution in Southern Italy. Among 10 patients whose symptoms improved after sarilumab treatment, rapid decreases in CRP levels corresponded with clinical improvement. Lower levels of IL-6 at baseline as well as lower neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio as compared with patients whose COVID-19 did not improve with treatment were associated with sarilumab-responsive disease.  Conclusions This observation may reflect a possible clinical benefit regarding early intervention with IL-6-modulatory therapies for COVID-19 and that CRP could be a potential biomarker of response to treatment.

Tocilizumab, an inhibitor of IL-6, has also been proposed as a treatment of critically ill patients. In this retrospective observational cohort study drawn from electronic health records we sought to describe the association between mortality and hydroxychloroquine or tocilizumab therapy among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients were hospitalized at a 13-hospital network spanning New Jersey USA between March 1, 2020 and April 22, 2020 with positive polymerase chain reaction results for SARS-CoV-2. Follow up was through May 5, 2020. Among 2512 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 there have been 547 deaths (22%), 1539 (61%) discharges and 426 (17%) remain hospitalized. 1914 (76%) received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and 1473 (59%) received hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. After adjusting for imbalances via propensity modeling, compared to receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in associated mortality for patients receiving any hydroxychloroquine during the hospitalization (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.80-1.22]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.83-1.27]), or hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.75-1.28]). The 30-day unadjusted mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, the combination or neither drug was 25%, 20%, 18%, and 20%, respectively. Among 547 evaluable ICU patients, including 134 receiving tocilizumab in the ICU, an exploratory analysis found a trend towards an improved survival association with tocilizumab treatment (adjusted HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.57-1.00]), with 30 day unadjusted mortality with and without tocilizumab of 46% versus 56%. This observational cohort study suggests hydroxychloroquine, either alone or in combination with azithromycin, was not associated with a survival benefit among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab demonstrated a trend association towards reduced mortality among ICU patients. Our findings are limited to hospitalized patients and must be interpreted with caution while awaiting results of randomized trials.

Despite uncertainties in the viral determinants and pathogenesis, it is crucial to accurately inspect all available evidence to construct accurate clinical guidelines for optimised patient care. This study aims to discuss the available evidence for the use of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) against COVID-19. Early in vitro studies of CQ/HCQ against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are convincing. But contradictory evidence exists on the clinical use of CQ/HCQ, either alone or in combination with azithromycin. As of now, there is no compelling clinical evidence on CQ, HCQ, and azithromycin in COVID-19 and the available evidence is limited to methodologically inferior non-randomised studies. Studies have also shown detrimental drug reactions to CQ and ‘HCQ plus azithromycin’, mainly cardiac side effects in hospitalised patients with coexisting cardiovascular comorbidities. Therefore, we recommend that physicians avoid high doses and exercise extreme caution in the compassionate use of CQ/HCQ, either alone or in combination with other antiviral drugs.

Prolonged QT Interval in a PatientWith Coronavirus Disease-2019: Beyond Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin	https://doi.org/10.1177/2324709620948407	12/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1177/2324709620948407	2324-7096	23247096	JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE MEDICINE HIGH IMPACT CASE REPORTS (ONLINE)	A4	0.296	15	1.13	  Recent reports have suggested an increased risk of QT prolongation and subsequent life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, particularly torsade de pointes, in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. In this article, we report the case of a 75-year-old female with a baseline prolonged QT interval in whom the COVID-19 illness resulted in further remarkable QT prolongation (&gt;700 ms), precipitating recurrent self-terminating episodes of torsade de pointes that necessitated temporary cardiac pacing. Despite the correction of hypoxemia and the absence of reversible factors, such as adverse medication effects, electrolyte derangements, and usage of hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, the QT interval remained persistently prolonged compared with the baseline with subsequent degeneration into ventricular tachycardia and death. Thus, we highlight that COVID-19 illness itself can potentially lead to further prolongation of QT interval and unmask fatal ventricular arrhythmias in patients who have a prolonged QT and low repolarization reserve at baseline.

Summary                   This case report describes a 42-year-old male with COVID-19 who developed a massive pulmonary embolism resulting in cardiac arrest after suspected failure of low-molecular-weight heparin therapy for a deep venous thrombosis. Administration of two 50-mg doses of intravenous alteplase resulted in return of spontaneous circulation, and low-dose argatroban was used as follow-up anticoagulation therapy without complications. This is the first case report of use of argatroban in a patient with COVID-19 with cardiac arrest–associated massive pulmonary embolism after failure of previous anticoagulation efforts.                                                  Conclusion                   Argatroban may be used as an alternate anticoagulation strategy in COVID-19 patients who fail low-molecular weight therapy. A risk versus benefit discussion should be had regarding appropriateness of therapy as well as dosing. More data is needed to understand the unique hypercoagulable condition in COVID-19 patients as well as research that further highlights the role of argatroban and bivalirudin therapy in this patient population.

The pursuit for an effective therapy led to the use of the antiviral drug Remdesivir for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. We reported two cases of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and worsening oxygen requirements. Both patients developed sinus bradycardia following the initiation of Remdesivir therapy and reverted after stopping it. One of the patients developed QTc interval prolongation and required intensive care unit admission. The proposed mechanism for Remdesivir-induced bradycardia and cardiac toxicity could be due to the intrinsic electrophysiological properties and the effect on the AV node; yet, further large observational studies are warranted for better understanding and correlation of Remdesivir with cardiac adverse events. Till then, healthcare providers need to be alert of this potential adverse event and to monitor their COVID-19 patients closely while on Remdesivir therapy.	32786041	Journal of medical virology	1096-9071	10.1002/jmv.26420

Vitamin D deficiency as a predictor of poor prognosis in patients with acute  respiratory failure due to COVID-19	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40618-020-01370-x	09/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40618-020-01370-x	1720-8386	17208386	JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION (ONLINE)	A3	0.936	87	4.35	 Abstract                  Purpose                 Hypovitaminosis D is a highly spread condition correlated with increased risk of respiratory tract infections. Nowadays, the world is in the grip of the Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID 19) pandemic. In these patients, cytokine storm is associated with disease severity. In consideration of the role of vitamin D in the immune system, aim of this study was to analyse vitamin D levels in patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and to assess any correlations with disease severity and prognosis.                                Methods                 In this retrospective, observational study, we analysed demographic, clinical and laboratory data of 42 patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19, treated in Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit (RICU) of the Policlinic of Bari from March, 11 to April 30, 2020.                                Results                 Eighty one percent of patients had hypovitaminosis D. Based on vitamin D levels, the population was stratified into four groups: no hypovitaminosis D, insufficiency, moderate deficiency, and severe deficiency. No differences regarding demographic and clinical characteristics were found. A survival analysis highlighted that, after 10 days of hospitalization, severe vitamin D deficiency patients had a 50% mortality probability, while those with vitamin D ≥ 10 ng/mL had a 5% mortality risk ( p = 0.019).                                Conclusions                 High prevalence of hypovitaminosis D was found in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure, treated in a RICU. Patients with severe vitamin D deficiency had a significantly higher mortality risk. Severe vitamin D deficiency may be a marker of poor prognosis in these patients, suggesting that adjunctive treatment might improve disease outcomes.

To compare the rate of clinical improvement between those who started LPV/ritonavir (LPV/r)+HCQ within 5 days of symptom onset (early treatment, ET) and those who started later (delayed treatment, DT). This was a retrospective intent-to-treat analysis of the hospitalized patients who started LPV/r + HCQ between 21 February and 20 March 2020. The association between the timing of treatment and the probability of 30-day mortality was assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic models. The study involved 172 patients: 43 (25%) in the ET and 129 (75%) in the DT group. The rate of clinical improvement increased over time to 73.3% on day 30, without any significant difference between the two groups (Gray's test P = .213). After adjusting for potentially relevant clinical variables, there was no significant association between the timing of the start of treatment and the probability of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] ET vs DT = 1.45, 95% confidence interval 0.50-4.19). Eight percent of the patients discontinued the treatment becausebecause of severe gastrointestinal disorders attributable to LPV/r. The timing of the start of LPV/r + HCQ treatment does not seem to affect the clinical course of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Together with the severe adverse events attributable to LPV/r, this raises concerns about the benefit of using this combination to treat COVID-19.	32776534	Journal of medical virology	1096-9071	10.1002/jmv.26407
Treatment of COVID-19 Patients with Convalescent Plasma Reveals a Signal of Significantly Decreased Mortality	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2020.08.001	10/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1016/j.ajpath.2020.08.001	0002-9440	00029440	THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY (PRINT)	A1	1.619	289	4.82	-	['Plasma convalescente']	['Convalescent Plasma']	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has spread globally, and proven treatments are limited. Transfusion of convalescent plasma collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 is among many approaches being studied as potentially efficacious therapy. We are conducting a prospective, propensity score-matched study assessing the efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion versus standard of care as treatment for severe and/or critical COVID-19. We present herein the results of an interim analysis of 316 patients enrolled at Houston Methodist hospitals from March 28 to July 6, 2020. Of the 316 transfused patients, 136 met a 28-day outcome and were matched to 251 non-transfused control COVID-19 patients. Matching criteria included age, sex, body mass index, comorbidities, and baseline ventilation requirement 48 hours from admission, and in a second matching analysis, ventilation status at day 0. Variability in the timing of transfusion relative to admission and titer of antibodies of plasma transfused allowed for analysis in specific matched cohorts. The analysis showed a significant reduction (P = 0.047) in mortality within 28 days, specifically in patients transfused within 72 hours of admission with plasma with an anti-spike protein receptor binding domain titer of ≥1:1350. These data suggest that treatment of COVID-19 with high anti-receptor binding domain IgG titer convalescent plasma is efficacious in early-disease patients.	32795424	The American journal of pathology	1525-2191	10.1016/j.ajpath.2020.08.001

Convalescent plasma a clutch at straws in COVID-19 management! A systematic review and meta-analysis	https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26408	10/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1002/jmv.26408	0146-6615	01466615	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY (PRINT)	B1	2.656	137	14.76	-	['Plasma convalescente']	['Convalescent Plasma']	In the absence of definitive therapy for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) may be a critical therapeutic option. This review was conducted to evaluate the impact of CPT in COVID-19 patients based on the publications reported to date. A robust screening of electronic databases was conducted up to 10th July 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case series with a control group evaluating the effectiveness and safety of CPT in patients with COVID-19 are included for the meta-analyses. Our search retrieved seven studies, including two RCTs and five cohort studies, with a total of 5444 patients. In patients with COVID-19, the use of CPT reduces mortality (odd's ratio [OR] 0.44; 95% CI, 0.25-0.77), increases viral clearance (OR, 11.29; 95% CI, 4.9-25.9) and improves clinically (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 0.8 to 4.9). However, the evidence is of low quality (mortality reduction, and viral clearance), and very low quality (clinical improvement). CPT may be beneficial for reducing mortality, viral shedding and improving clinical conditions in COVID-19 patients. However, further randomized control trials (RCT) are required to substantiate the safety margin, initiation, optimal dosage, titre and duration of CPT.	32776573	Journal of medical virology	1096-9071	10.1002/jmv.26408

Baricitinib, a drug with potential effect to prevent SARS-COV-2 from entering target cells and control cytokine storm induced by COVID-19	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106749	01/07/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106749	1567-5769	15675769	INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY (PRINT)	A2	1.059	119	5.61	-	['Baricitinibe']	['Baricitinib']	In December 2019, a novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suddenly broke out in China and rapidly spread all over the world. Recently, a cell surface protein, known as angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), has been identified to be involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis for SARS-CoV-2 entry to the cells. Many studies have reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19: sudden deterioration of disease around 1-2 weeks after onset; much lower level of lymphocytes, especially natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood; extremely high pro-inflammatory cytokines and C reactive protein (CRP). About 15.7% of patients develop severe pneumonia, and cytokine storm is an important factor leading to rapid disease progression. Currently, there are no specific drugs for COVID-19 and the cytokine storm it causes. Baricitinib intracellularly inhibits the proinflammatory signal of several cytokines by suppressing Janus kinase (JAK) JAK1/JAK2. It has been demonstrated clinical benefits for the patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), active systemic lupus erythematosus and atopic dermatitis with good efficacy and safety records. Baricitinib is expected to interrupt the passage and intracellular assembly of SARS-CoV-2 into the target cells mediated by ACE2 receptor, and treat cytokine storm caused by COVID-19. Several clinical trials are currently investigating the drug, and one of which has been completed with encouraging results. In this paper, we will elaborate the role of cytokine storm mediated by JAK-STAT pathway in severe COVID-19, the possible mechanisms of baricitinib on reducing the viral entry into the target cells and cytokine storm, the key points of pharmaceutical care based on the latest research reports, clinical trials progress and drug instruction from the US FDA, so as to provide reference for the treatment of severe COVID-19.	32645632	International immunopharmacology	1878-1705	10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106749

The antiviral treatment acts as one of the most important means of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Alteration of physiological characteristics in special populations may lead to the change in drug pharmacokinetics, which may result in treatment failure or increased adverse drug reactions. Some potential drugs have shown antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2 infections, such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, interferon alpha, and remedsivir. Here, we reviewed the literature on clinical effects in COVID-19 patients of these antiviral agents and provided the potential antiviral agent options for pregnant women, elderly patients, liver or renal dysfunction patients, and severe or critically ill patients receiving renal replacement therapy or ECMO after SARS-CoV-2 infection.	32801640	Drug design, development and therapy	1177-8881	10.2147/DDDT.S259058

A large number of reports have explained the clinical characteristics and treatment strategies of COVID-19, but the characteristics and treatment of COVID-19 patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are still unclear. Here, we report the clinical features and treatment of the first SLE patient with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. This was a 39-year-old woman, diagnosed with SLE 15 years ago, whose overall clinical characteristics (symptoms, laboratory tests, and chest CTs) were similar to those of the general COVID-19 patients. She continued to take the previous SLE drugs (doses of glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine, and immunosuppressive agents were not reduced) and was treated with strict antiviral and infection prevention treatment. After the first discharge, she got a recurrence of COVID-19 during her home isolation, and then returned to hospital and continued the previous therapy. Finally, this long-term immune suppressive patient's COVID-19 was successfully cured. The successful recovery of this case has significant reference value for the future treatment of COVID-19 patients with SLE. Key Points • COVID-19 patients with SLE is advocated to continue the medical treatment for SLE. • Hydroxychloroquine may have potential benefits for COVID-19 patients with SLE. • COVID-19 patients with SLE is prone to relapse, and multiple follow-ups are necessary.	32725351	Clinical rheumatology	1434-9949	10.1007/s10067-020-05230-0

In the light of its rapid global spreading, on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic. Interestingly, the global spreading of the disease is not uniform, but has so far left some countries relatively less affected. The reason(s) for this anomalous behavior are not fully understood, but distinct hypotheses have been proposed. Here we discuss the plausibility of two of them: the universal vaccination with  Bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) and the widespread use of the antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ). Both have been amply discussed in the recent literature with positive and negative conclusions: we felt that a comprehensive presentation of the data available on them would be useful. The analysis of data for countries with over 1000 reported COVID-19 cases has shown that the incidence and mortality were higher in countries in which BCG vaccination is either absent or has been discontinued, as compared with the countries with universal vaccination. We have performed a similar analysis of the data available for CQ, a widely used drug in the African continent and in other countries in which malaria is endemic; we discuss it here because CQ has been used as the drug to treat COVID-19 patients. Several African countries no longer recommend it officially for the fight against malaria, due to the development of resistance to  Plasmodium, but its use across the continent is still diffuse. Taken together, the data in the literature have led to the suggestion of a possible inverse correlation between BCG immunization and COVID-19 disease incidence and severity.

Eleven studies were included with 33 483 patients. ACEI/ARB therapy might be associated with the reduced inflammatory factor (interleukin-6) and elevated immune cells counts (CD3, CD8). Meta-analysis showed no significant increase in the risk of COVID-19 infection (odds ratio [OR]: 0.95, 95%CI: 0.89-1.05) in patients receiving ACEI/ARB therapy, and ACEI/ARB therapy was associated with a decreased risk of severe COVID-19 (OR: 0.75, 95%CI: 0.59-0.96) and mortality (OR: 0.52, 95%CI: 0.35-0.79). Subgroup analyses showed among the general population, ACEI/ARB therapy was associated with reduced severe COVID-19 infection (OR: 0.79, 95%CI: 0.60-1.05) and all-cause mortality (OR: 0.31, 95%CI: 0.13-0.75), and COVID-19 infection (OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.66-1.08) were not increased. Among patients with hypertension, the use of an ACEI/ARB was associated with a lower severity of COVID-19 (OR: 0.73, 95%CI: 0.51-1.03) and lower mortality (OR: 0.57, 95%CI: 0.37-0.87), without evidence of an increased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.00). On the basis of the available evidence, ACEI/ARB therapy should be continued in patients who are at risk for, or have COVID-19, either in general population or hypertension patients. Our results need to be interpreted with caution considering the potential for residual confounders, and more well-designed studies that control the clinical confounders are necessary to confirm our findings.	32757246	Clinical cardiology	1932-8737	10.1002/clc.23421

Venous thromboembolism in critically ill COVID-19 patients receiving prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation: a systematic review	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11239-020-02235-z	03/08/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1007/s11239-020-02235-z	0929-5305	09295305	JOURNAL OF THROMBOSIS AND THROMBOLYSIS	A2	0.974	72	3.8	 Abstract Many aspects of care such as management of hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 patients, especially those admitted to intensive care units is challenging in the rapidly evolving pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We seek to systematically review the available evidence regarding the anticoagulation approach to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) among COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units. Electronic databases were searched for studies reporting venous thromboembolic events in patients admitted to the intensive care unit receiving any type of anticoagulation (prophylactic or therapeutic). The pooled prevalence (and 95% confidence interval [CI]) of VTE among patients receiving anticoagulant were calculated using the random-effects model. Subgroup pooled analyses were performed with studies reported prophylactic anticoagulation alone and with studies reported mixed prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation. We included twelve studies (8 Europe; 2 UK; 1 each from the US and China) in our systematic review and meta-analysis. All studies utilized LMWH or unfractionated heparin as their pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, either prophylactic doses or therapeutic doses. Seven studies reported on the proportion of patients with the previous history of VTE (range 0–10%). The pooled prevalence of VTE among ICU patients receiving prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation across all studies was 31% (95% CI 20–43%). Subgroup pooled analysis limited to studies reported prophylactic anticoagulation alone and mixed (therapeutic and prophylactic anticoagulation) reported pooled prevalences of VTE of 38% (95% CI 10–70%) and 27% (95% CI 17–40%) respectively. With a high prevalence of thromboprophylaxis failure among COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units, individualised rather than protocolised VTE thromboprophylaxis would appear prudent at interim.

This has become a public health emergency of international concern. No specific vaccine and medicine have proven effective in large-sized trials at this time. With the rapidly increasing number of positive cases and deaths, there is a dire need for effective treatments and an effective vaccine for prevention. An urgent unmet need led to the planning and opening of multiple drug development trials for treatment and vaccine development. In this article, we have summarized data on cell receptor interactions and data on prospects of new vaccines targeting the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), and viral minigenes. We have tabulated the available data on various clinical trials testing various aspects of COVID-19 vaccines.	32754408	Cureus	2168-8184	10.7759/cureus.8871

Authorities and physicians are still learning how COVID-19 affects people with underlying diseases, and severe asthma is not an exception. Unless relevant data emerge that change our understanding of the relative safety of medications indicated in patients with asthma during this pandemic, clinicians must follow the recommendations of current evidence-based guidelines for preventing loss of control and exacerbations. Also, with the absence of data that would indicate any potential harm, current advice is to continue the administration of biological therapies during the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with asthma for whom such therapies are clearly indicated and have been effective. For patients with severe asthma infected by SARS-CoV-2, the decision to maintain or postpone biological therapy until the patient recovers should be a case-by-case based decision supported by a multidisciplinary team. A registry of cases of COVID-19 in patients with severe asthma, including those treated with biologics, will help to address a clinical challenge in which we have more questions than answers.	32426090	The World Allergy Organization journal	1939-4551	10.1016/j.waojou.2020.100126

No drug has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy for COVID-19. Immunomodulatory treatment with hydroxychloroquine and biologics as tocilizumab, in fact, has not proven to show satisfactory results in several reports. We therefore treated a selected patient with interstitial multifocal pneumonia, positive to COVID-19, with polyclonal preparation of immunoglobulins as an adjuvant therapy, obtaining in few days clinical remission and improvements in radiological findings. Based on this case report, we suggest that clinical trials are conducted to test the efficacy and safety of polyclonal immunoglobulins for adjunctive therapy of COVID-19.	32766266	Frontiers in medicine	2296-858X	10.3389/fmed.2020.00388
Clinical outcomes of COVID‑19 in Wuhan, China: a large cohort study	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-020-00706-3	31/07/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1186/s13613-020-00706-3	2110-5820	21105820	ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE	A1	2.219	60	7.23	 Abstract  Background Since December 2019, an outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) initially emerged in Wuhan, China, and has spread worldwide now. Clinical features of patients with COVID-19 have been described. However, risk factors leading to in-hospital deterioration and poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients with severe disease have not been well identified.  Methods In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, 1190 adult inpatients (≥ 18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and determined outcomes (discharged or died) were included from Wuhan Infectious Disease Hospital from December 29, 2019 to February 28, 2020. The final follow-up date was March 2, 2020. Clinical data including characteristics, laboratory and imaging information as well as treatments were extracted from electronic medical records and compared. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to explore the potential predictors associated with in-hospital deterioration and death.  Results 1190 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Their median age was 57 years (interquartile range 47–67 years). Two hundred and sixty-one patients (22%) developed a severe illness after admission. Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that higher SOFA score (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.22–1.43, per score increase,  p &lt; 0.001 for deterioration and OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11–1.53, per score increase,  p = 0.001 for death), lymphocytopenia (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.13–2.89  p = 0.013 for deterioration; OR 4.44, 95% CI 1.26–15.87,  p = 0.021 for death) on admission were independent risk factors for in-hospital deterioration from not severe to severe disease and for death in severe patients. On admission D-dimer greater than 1 μg/L (OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.19–9.04,  p = 0.021), leukocytopenia (OR 5.10, 95% CI 1.25–20.78), thrombocytopenia (OR 8.37, 95% CI 2.04–34.44) and history of diabetes (OR 11.16, 95% CI 1.87–66.57,  p = 0.008) were also associated with higher risks of in-hospital death in severe COVID-19 patients. Shorter time interval from illness onset to non-invasive mechanical ventilation in the survivors with severe disease was observed compared with non-survivors (10.5 days, IQR 9.25–11.0 vs. 16.0 days, IQR 11.0–19.0 days,  p = 0.030). Treatment with glucocorticoids increased the risk of progression from not severe to severe disease (OR 3.79, 95% CI 2.39–6.01,  p &lt; 0.001). Administration of antiviral drugs especially oseltamivir or ganciclovir is associated with a decreased risk of death in severe patients (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05–0.64,  p &lt; 0.001).  Conclusions High SOFA score and lymphocytopenia on admission could predict that not severe patients would develop severe disease in-hospital. On admission elevated D-dimer, leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and diabetes were independent risk factors of in-hospital death in severe patients with COVID-19. Administration of oseltamivir or ganciclovir might be beneficial for reducing mortality in severe patients.

Likewise, SARS-CoV2 infection can be fatal as the disease advances to pneumonia, followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The development of lethal clinical symptons is associated with an exaggerated production of inflammatory cytokines, referred to as the cytokine storm, is a consequence of a hyperactivated immune response aginst the infection. In this article, we discuss the pathogenic consequences of the cytokine storm and its relationship with COVID-19 associated risk factors. The increased pro-inflammatory immune status in patients with risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, COPD) exacerbates the Cytokine-storm of COVID-19 into a 'Cytokine Super Cyclone'. We also evaluate the antiviral immune responses provided by BCG vaccination and the potential role of 'trained immunity' in early protection against SARS-CoV2.	32747157	Cytokine & growth factor reviews	1879-0305	10.1016/j.cytogfr.2020.06.014

The WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic event on Mar 12, 2020, and the number of confirmed cases is still on the rise worldwide. While most infected individuals only experience mild symptoms or may even be asymptomatic, some patients rapidly progress to severe acute respiratory failure with substantial mortality, making it imperative to develop an efficient treatment for severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia alongside supportive care. So far, the optimal treatment strategy for severe COVID-19 remains unknown. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a blood product pooled from healthy donors with high concentrations of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and has been used in patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases for more than 30 years. In this review, we aim to highlight the known mechanisms of immunomodulatory effects of high-dose IVIg therapy, the immunopathological hypothesis of viral pneumonia, and the clinical evidence of IVIg therapy in viral pneumonia. We then make cautious therapeutic inferences about high-dose IVIg therapy in treating severe COVID-19. These inferences may provide relevant and useful insights in order to aid treatment for COVID-19.	32760407	Frontiers in immunology	1664-3224	10.3389/fimmu.2020.01660

Even as the efficacy of this combination is under evaluation, clinicians have begun to use it largely. As these medications are known to prolong the QT interval, we analyzed serial electrocardiograms recorded in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with HCQ + AZ. Fifty consecutive patients received the combination of HCQ (600 mg/d for 10 days) and AZ (500 mg/d on day 1 and 250 mg/d from day 2 to day 5). Twelve-lead electrocardiograms were recorded before treatment, at day 3, at day 5, and at discharge. The median age of patients was 68 years (interquartile range, 53-81 years); 28 (56%) were men. The main comorbidities were hypertension (36%; n=18) and diabetes (16%; n=8). The mean corrected QT (QTc) interval was 408 ms at baseline and increased up to 437 ms at day 3 and to 456 ms at day 5. Thirty-eight patients (76%) presented short-term modifications of the QTc duration (>30 ms). Treatment discontinuation was decided in 6 patients (12%), leading to QTc normalization in 5 of them. No deaths and no cardiac arrhythmic events were observed in this cohort. Our report confirms that a short duration treatment with HCQ + AZ modifies the QTc interval. The treatment had to be discontinued for QTc modifications in 12% of patients. Nevertheless, in inpatients hospitalized for COVID-19, we did not observe any clinically relevant consequences of these transitory modifications. In conclusion, when patients are treated with HCQ + AZ, cardiac monitoring should be regularly performed and hospital settings allow monitoring under in safe conditions.	32753141	Mayo Clinic proceedings	1942-5546	10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.05.005

This plays a major role in COVID-19 severity and poor disease prognosis, even death. Higher levels of inflammatory hallmarks including C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimers, and cytokines such as interleukin (IL) -6, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α) have been reported. Many anti-viral drugs have been tried, but none were proven fully effective. Supportive care and management of the complications that are caused mainly by inflammation might be the key to greater survival rates and shorter hospitalization (e.g., the use of remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, umifenovir (arbidol), oseltamivir, ganciclovir, favipiravir, darunavir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, colchicine, azithromycin, anakinra, canakinumab, tocilizumab, siltuximab, sarilumab, Type 1 interferon, interferon β-1a, interferon α- 2b, baricitinib, ruxolitinib, fedratinib, methylprednisolone and dexamethasone). However, the efficacy of these treatments still needs well-planned clinical trials. In such trials, careful attention must be paid to the duration of the treatment, the onset of beneficial effects, and the severity of the disease, otherwise, the outcomes may still remain inconclusive. Herein, we present a review of the current drugs, which are being used in the management of the disease and their anti-inflammatory properties. We also investigated if these drugs directly interact with Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE 2), which is a crucial component of the virus entry to the cells.	32735768	Journal of pharmacy & pharmaceutical sciences : a publication of the Canadian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Societe canadienne des sciences pharmaceutiques	1482-1826	10.18433/jpps31346
Ascorbate as Prophylaxis and Therapy for COVID-19—Update From Shanghai and U.S. Medical Institutions	https://doi.org/10.1177/2164956120934768	20/07/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1177/2164956120934768	2164-9561	21649561	Global Advances In Health and Medicine	-	0.448	21	1.9	  Background  No validated treatments have been identified for the COVID-19 pandemic virus; several are currently in randomized clinical trials. Diagnostic instruments are rapidly evolving. Symptoms range from those of a common cold to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), to sepsis arising from the flood of inflammatory bacterial and viral pathogens in the blood. Mortality generally arises from cytokine storms of uncontrolled inflammation, oxidative injury, and damage to the alveolar-capillary barrier, with secondary bacterial infection. To address the indisputably urgent need for therapeutics for COVID-19, a specialized interdisciplinary medical panel convened in Shanghai in March 2020 to consider all relevant clinical and experimental evidence on the possible utility of intravenous (IV) ascorbate in the treatment of COVID-19-related ARDS.   Methods  The panel convened multidisciplinary medical experts and reviewed all relevant in vitro, in vivo, clinical studies and randomized controlled trials on IV ascorbate and issued a consensus report on 23 March 2020 noting that substantial differences in serum concentrations of ascorbate are achieved through IV administration in contrast with the oral route.   Findings  The Shanghai panel, and a parallel medical group in Guangzhou, are advising the use of high-dose IV ascorbate for the treatment of ARDS, along with other supportive therapies, including Vitamin D and zinc. We report preliminary progress in using this treatment for 50 consecutive cases treated in Shanghai hospitals, consistent with earlier reports from a meta-analysis of the use of IV ascorbate to treat sepsis. We provide an instructive clinical anecdote regarding a single family where one elderly member with cardiac and other major comorbidities developed and survived ARDS-related sepsis following daily treatments that included 15 g of IV ascorbate. None of her adult caregivers who had ingested between 2 and 10 g of ascorbate daily developed COVID-19.

This was a retrospective study using a consecutive cohort of 224 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in March 2020. Patients were divided into those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU group) and those not (no ICU group), and clinical data including usage of tocilizumab were compared. Correlation between IL-6 value at admission and at peak, and tocilizumab use, as well as clinical outcomes were also investigated. The ICU group had higher rates of pre-existing comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary disease, and higher IL-6 than no ICU group (all P < .05). Age, peak IL-6, and peak d-dimer were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality (1.05 [1.01-1.09], P = .012; 1.001 [1.000-1.002], P = .002; 1.10 [1.03-1.18], P = .008). Receiver operating characteristics curve showed higher predictability of in-hospital mortality with IL-6 at peak than others (area under curve; IL-6 at peak: 0.875 [0.87-0.942], IL-6 at admission: 0.794 [0.699-0.889], d-dimer at peak 0.787 [0.690-0.883], d-dimer at admission 0.726 [0.625-0.827]). Incidence of fungal infections was significantly higher in patients who were given tocilizumab than those who were not (13.0% vs 1.1%, P < .001). Notably, tocilizumab did not affect in-hospital mortality after adjustment including IL-6 (odds ratio [95% confidential interval]: 1.00 [0.27-3.72, P = .998]).

This was a retrospective study using a consecutive cohort of 224 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in March 2020. Patients were divided into those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU group) and those not (no ICU group), and clinical data including usage of tocilizumab were compared. Correlation between IL-6 value at admission and at peak, and tocilizumab use, as well as clinical outcomes were also investigated. The ICU group had higher rates of pre-existing comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary disease, and higher IL-6 than no ICU group (all P < .05). Age, peak IL-6, and peak d-dimer were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality (1.05 [1.01-1.09], P = .012; 1.001 [1.000-1.002], P = .002; 1.10 [1.03-1.18], P = .008). Receiver operating characteristics curve showed higher predictability of in-hospital mortality with IL-6 at peak than others (area under curve; IL-6 at peak: 0.875 [0.87-0.942], IL-6 at admission: 0.794 [0.699-0.889], d-dimer at peak 0.787 [0.690-0.883], d-dimer at admission 0.726 [0.625-0.827]). Incidence of fungal infections was significantly higher in patients who were given tocilizumab than those who were not (13.0% vs 1.1%, P < .001). Notably, tocilizumab did not affect in-hospital mortality after adjustment including IL-6 (odds ratio [95% confidential interval]: 1.00 [0.27-3.72, P = .998]). Age, peak IL-6, and peak d-dimer levels were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality. Tocilizumab did not decrease in-hospital mortality in our cohort.	33153994	Heart (British Cardiac Society)	1468-201X	10.1136/heartjnl-2020-318312

After suggestions and assessments of several therapeutic options, remdesivir (GS-5734), a direct-acting antiviral drug previously tested against Ebola virus disease, was found to be moderately effective and probably safe for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication. Finally, on 1 May 2020, remdesivir (GS-5734) was granted emergency use authorization as an investigational drug for the treatment of Covid-19 by the Food and Drug Administration. However, without a doubt, there are challenging days ahead. Here, we provide a review of the latest findings (based on preprints, post-prints, and news releases in scientific websites) related to remdesivir efficacy and safety for the treatment of Covid-19, along with covering remdesivir history from bench-to-bedside, as well as an overview of its mechanism of action. In addition, active clinical trials, as well as challenging issues related to the future of remdesivir in Covid-19, are covered. Up to the date of writing this review (19 May 2020), there is one finished randomized clinical trial and two completed non-randomized studies, in addition to some ongoing studies, including three observational studies, two expanded access studies, and seven active clinical trials registered on the clinicaltrials.gov and isrctn.com websites. Based on these studies, it seems that remdesivir could be an effective and probably safe treatment option for Covid-19. However, more randomized controlled studies are required.	33210457	Reviews in medical virology	1099-1654	10.1002/rmv.2133

In this multicenter retrospective cohort study we included adult patients with COVID-19, need of respiratory support, and elevated C-reactive protein who received intravenous tocilizumab in addition to standard of care. Control patients not receiving tocilizumab were matched for sex, age and respiratory support. We selected survival as the primary endpoint, along with need for invasive ventilation, thrombosis, hemorrhage, and infections as secondary endpoints at 30 days. We included 64 patients with COVID-19 in the tocilizumab group and 64 matched controls. At baseline the tocilizumab group had longer symptom duration (13 ± 5 vs. 9 ± 5 days) and received hydroxychloroquine more often than controls (100% vs. 81%). The mortality rate was similar between groups (27% with tocilizumab vs. 38%) and at multivariable analysis risk of death was not significantly influenced by tocilizumab (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.33-1.15), while being associated with the use at baseline of non invasive mechanical or invasive ventilation, and the presence of comorbidities. Among secondary outcomes, tocilizumab was associated with a lower probability of requiring invasive ventilation (hazard ratio 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.16-0.83; P = 0.017) but not with the risk of thrombosis, bleeding, or infections. The use of intravenous tocilizumab was not associated with changes in 30-day mortality in patients with COVID-19 severe respiratory impairment. Among the secondary outcomes there was less use of invasive ventilation in the tocilizumab group.	32713677	Journal of autoimmunity	1095-9157	10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102511

Following peak utilization, use of all study drugs decreased at different times throughout April 2020. The data were used to provide information to various stakeholders in the drug supply chain during the initial surge of the pandemic.                                                  Conclusion                   This analysis describes the increased use, beginning in mid-March 2020, of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, midazolam, propofol, ketamine, cisatracurium, and fentanyl in 47 hospitals in New York State. The increased utilization of supportive therapy drugs was consistent with the surge in patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19 during the study period. These data and observations can help clinicians, health-system leaders, manufacturers, wholesalers, and policymakers understand the impact of current and future pandemics on the drug supply chain.

Retrospective Multicenter Cohort Study Shows Early Interferon Therapy Is Associated with Favorable Clinical Responses in COVID-19 Patients	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.07.005	18/07/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1016/j.chom.2020.07.005	1931-3128	19313128	CELL HOST & MICROBE	A1	9.373	201	19.72	-	['Interferon alfa']	['Interferon alpha']	Interferons (IFNs) are widely used in treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, a recent report of ACE2, the host factor mediating SARS-Cov-2 infection, identifying it as interferon-stimulated raised considerable safety concern. To examine the association between the use and timing of IFN-α2b and clinical outcomes, we analyzed in a retrospective multicenter cohort study of 446 COVID-19 patients in Hubei, China. Regression models estimated that early administration (≤5 days after admission) of IFN-α2b was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in comparison with no admission of IFN-α2b, whereas late administration of IFN-α2b was associated with increased mortality. Among survivors, early IFN-α2b was not associated with hospital discharge or computed tomography (CT) scan improvement, whereas late IFN-α2b was associated with delayed recovery. Additionally, early IFN-α2b and umifenovir alone or together were associated with reduced mortality and accelerated recovery in comparison with treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) alone. We concluded that administration of IFN-α2b during the early stage of COVID-19 could induce favorable clinical responses.	32707096	Cell host & microbe	1934-6069	10.1016/j.chom.2020.07.005

There are limited data about the clinical course of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients infected with COVID-19. However, previous cohort studies showed a high mortality rate of ESRD patients infected with COVID-19. We report here two Japanese ESRD patients confirmed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Case 1 was a 60-year-old man with ESRD due to diabetic nephropathy who were infected with COVID-19 and exhibited acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. He was treated with tocilizumab and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). After 6 days of treatment in ICU, he was extubated. Case 2 was a 68-year-old woman undergoing maintenance hemodialysis for 17 years who also exhibited ARDS due to COVID-19. Her clinical course resembles case 1. Our experience of these two cases indicates that anti-cytokine therapy might be effective for severe COVID-19 pneumonia in ESRD patients.	32715376	CEN case reports	2192-4449	10.1007/s13730-020-00512-7

Thus far there are no proven therapeutic options to treat COVID-19. We report a case of COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome who was treated with high-dose vitamin C infusion and was the first case to have early recovery from the disease at our institute. CASE REPORT A 74-year-old woman with no recent sick contacts or travel history presented with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Her vital signs were normal except for oxygen saturation of 87% and bilateral rhonchi on lung auscultation. Chest radiography revealed air space opacity in the right upper lobe, suspicious for pneumonia. A nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 came back positive while the patient was in the airborne-isolation unit. Laboratory data showed lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, and interleukin-6. The patient was initially started on oral hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. On day 6, she developed ARDS and septic shock, for which mechanical ventilation and pressor support were started, along with infusion of high-dose intravenous vitamin C. The patient improved clinically and was able to be taken off mechanical ventilation within 5 days. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights the potential benefits of high-dose intravenous vitamin C in critically ill COVID-19 patients in terms of rapid recovery and shortened length of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. Further studies will elaborate on the efficacy of intravenous vitamin C in critically ill COVID-19.	32709838	The American journal of case reports	1941-5923	10.12659/AJCR.925521

A search has been performed for studies using IL-6 blocking drugs (tocilizumab, siltuximab, and sarilumab) in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Also, a search of ongoing trials registered at clinicaltrials.gov was performed. We found very little published clinical experience with these drugs, consisting mainly of case reports or case series with few patients.

Most of them were males (75.8%). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (80.5%), cough (63.4%), and fatigue (41.5%). Patients were classified into three catalogs according to severity of pneumonia: 17 (41.5%) were mild, 15 (36.6%) severe, and 9 (21.9%) critical disease. Laboratory tests revealed that serum creatinine of critical patients was significantly higher than that of mild or severe patients. 68.3% received oxygen support; all patients received antiviral therapy, and 15 (36.6%) recipients were additionally treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and interferon-α. 19.5% of patients maintained immunosuppressive therapy; 36.6% suspended antimetabolite; and 43.9% only treated with corticosteroid. Six (14.6%) patients died (severe: 2, critical: 4); high creatinine with low lymphocyte count was the biggest challenge of immunosuppression management.

The morbidity and mortality of the infection varies based upon patient age, comorbid conditions, viral load, and the availability of effective treatments. Findings from limited autopsies, clinical observations, and laboratory data suggest that high cytokine levels and a procoagulant state can precipitate acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome in critically ill patients. To complicate matters, comorbidities may affect the response to medical treatments currently in use, all of which are still in trial phase. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) merits consideration in the treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients and is an avenue for clinical trials to pursue. If efficacious, faster recovery of patients may lead to shorter intensive care unit stays and less time on mechanical ventilation. Herein, we briefly discuss some of the various approaches currently being investigated for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 with a focus on potential benefits of TPE for selected critically ill patients.

We here demonstrate suppressive but not curative effect of remdesivir in an immunocompromised patient. A man in his fifties treated with chemoimmunotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia experienced a 9-week course of COVID-19 with high fever and severe viral pneumonia. During two 10-day courses of remdesivir starting 24 and 45 days after fever onset, pneumonia and spiking fevers remitted, but relapsed after discontinuation. Kinetics of temperature, C-reactive protein, and lymphocyte counts mirrored the remitting/relapsing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Combination therapy or longer treatment duration may be needed in immunocompromised patients.	['Remdesivir']	['Remdesivir']	-	-	-	-	-

Excessive immune responses trigger life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) which can result in overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1β with different pro-inflammatory roles. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the modulation of systemic immune responses may have a potential role in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Given the importance of the issue and the lack of therapeutic treatment or vaccine; anti-cytokine therapy such as IL-6, TNFα and IL-1 antagonists have been suggested for the alleviation of hyper-inflammation status in these patients. In this mini-review, we addressed the inflammatory pathways of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its relationship with the host cytokine storm. Furthermore, the proposed therapeutic options to reverse hyper-inflammation in infected patients were mentioned.	32682575	Archives of medical research	1873-5487	10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.06.012

There is weak evidence on the antiviral and immunomodulating effects of azithromycin, which in addition is not based on results from COVID-19 patients specifically. Therefore, this antibacterial should be considered only as empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), although not all current treatment guidelines are in agreement. After the initial expectations raised by a small trial, more recent evidence has raised serious safety concerns on the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with azithromycin to treat COVID-19 patients, as all these drugs have arrhythmogenic potential. The World Health Organization has not made recommendations suggesting the use of azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine as treatment for COVID-19, but some national organisations have taken a different position, recommending this as first-line treatment.

There is currently no authorized medication for the treatment of COVID-19. No vaccines have been authorized. Thus, this study aimed at conducting a review of the use of Remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. The following electronic databases were used MEDLINE, SCIELO, LILACS, and PUBMED. On May 1, Remdesivir received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. Remdesivir is currently the most promising molecule in the treatment of COVID-19, taking into account its broad antiviral spectrum (considering the genetic sequences of the virus, it is expected to maintain activity against SARS-CoV-2). There is in vitro and in vivo information available for coronaviruses, as well as an extensive clinical safety database (from a clinical trial of the Ebola virus and in the context of the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions - MEURI). Further studies are relevant as available data on the efficacy and safety of Remdesivir against SARS-nCoV-2 are limited.	['Remdesivir']	['Remdesivir']	-	-	-	-	-

So far, there are no established management options and prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and those who develop COVID-19. Documented scientific evidences in similar viral outbreaks in past suggested few therapy regimens. These rather have not shown promising results in management of current pandemic. So, in the current review, we are exploring novel treatment strategies and therapies that are being explored and are in clinical and preclinical stages of research. To explore more about the same, we directed our search towards stem cell based, DNA based, or RNA based vaccines against COVID-19 under development by various universities, institutes or pharmaceutical companies. The current scientific literature and database search were performed by exploring various Trials registry (NIH: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ and https://www.coronavirus.gov) and Chinese clinical trial registry http://www.chictr.org.cn/) and for preclinical trials various University, Institutions, Pharmaceutical companies websites and news bulletins along with google search were checked routinely from 3rd March 2020 to 16 May 2020. The term "Stem Cell therapy and COVID-19", "Mesenchymal stem cell and corona 2019 virus", "DNA Vaccines and COVID-19, RNA Vaccines and COVID-19" and "Cell-based therapy with SARS-CoV-2, University/Institutions and COVID-19 research" were used. The vaccine trials (Stem Cells/DNA/RNA) which were cancelled were not included in this review. Similarly, few others like repurposing of drugs, Nano Vaccines, other miscellaneous trials of Herbs, Music therapy etc., were also excluded. In the present review, we have included the various novel therapies like stem cell therapy, DNA or RNA vaccines which are under development and if proven successful may have a lasting impact on the health industry.	32837030	Indian journal of clinical biochemistry : IJCB	0970-1915	10.1007/s12291-020-00907-4

Solid organ transplant recipients who are on chronic immunosuppressants fall within a special population of COVID-19 patients since they are more susceptible to complications secondary to COVID-19. Currently, we do not have data on treating COVID-19 patients with solid organ transplants with tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitor. We report a case of COVID-19 in a patient with a kidney and liver transplant and discuss the early use of tocilizumab to prevent the cytokine storm and attempt to reduce the likelihood of progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In addition, we present other COVID-19 related transplant cases reported in the literature outlining the presenting clinical signs and outcomes.	32685369	IDCases	2214-2509	10.1016/j.idcr.2020.e00888

An intense inflammatory response may cause an imbalance in the coagulation cascade making both thrombosis and bleeding common and notable features of the clinical management of these patients. Large observational and retrospective studies provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology and management of bleeding and thrombosis in COVID-19 patients requiring ECMO. Clinically significant bleeding, including intracerebral hemorrhage, is an independent predictor of mortality, and thrombosis (particularly pulmonary embolism) is associated with mortality, especially if occurring with right ventricular dysfunction. The incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is higher than the general patient cohort with acute respiratory distress syndrome or other indications for ECMO. The use of laboratory parameters to predict bleeding or thrombosis has a limited role. In this review, the authors discuss the complex pathophysiology of bleeding and thrombosis observed in patients with COVID-19 during ECMO support, and their effects on outcomes.	32628001	Kardiologia polska	1897-4279	10.33963/KP.15489

After spreading around the world, a pandemic was declared by the WHO. Depending on the different involvement of the disease, the most common symptoms are fever, cough, and dyspnea. However, some indeterminate symptoms that make diagnosis difficult, such as myalgia and fatigue, can also be seen alone, without the typical clinical picture. We describe a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia, the only complaint of which is myalgia, and the first diagnosis is mild rhabdomyolysis. The patient had no evidence or history other than viral infection that could explain muscle pain and also increased level of muscle enzymes. When mild rhabdomyolysis lack of myoglobinuria and complications was diagnosed, treatment-related rhabdomyolysis was also avoided as no treatment related to COVID-19 was initiated yet. Apart from the typical symptoms leading to the typical diagnosis of COVID-19 at the first admission, SARS-CoV-2 related with rhabdomyolysis should also be kept in mind.	32563271	The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene	1476-1645	tpmd200583

In a retrospective study of 65 patients treated with LPV/r and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for severe forms of COVID-19 (median age: 67; males: 41 [63.1%]), 33 (50.8%) displayed a grade ≥2 increase in plasma levels of hepatobiliary markers, lipase and/or triglycerides. A causal relationship between LPV/r and the AE was suspected in 9 of the 65 patients (13.8%). At 400 mg b.i.d., the plasma trough concentrations of LPV/r were high and showed marked interindividual variability (median [interquartile range]: 16,600 [11,430-20,842] ng/ml for lopinavir and 501 [247-891] ng/ml for ritonavir). The trough lopinavir concentration was negatively correlated with body mass index, while the trough ritonavir concentration was positively correlated with age and negatively correlated with prothrombin activity. However, the occurrence of abnormal laboratory values was not associated with higher trough plasma concentrations of LPV/r. Further studies will be needed to determine the value of TDM in LPV/r-treated patients with COVID-19.	32692462	British journal of clinical pharmacology	1365-2125	10.1111/bcp.14489

However, this trial has several major methodological issues, including the design, outcome measure and the statistical analyses.

Results                   From January 30, 2020, to February 6, 2020, a total of 30 patients were enrolled, of whom 18 (60%) were male, aged 47.2 ± 2.8 years; 63.3% (19/30) of the participants had fever, and 46.7% (14/30) had cough at enrollment. The participants were randomized (range) at 4 (2–5) days after onset of symptoms. The proportion of negative PCR results at day 7 was 46.7% (7/15) and 60.0% (9/15) in the DRV/c and control groups (P = .72), respectively. The viral clearance rate at day 3 was 20% (3/15) in both study groups, while the number increased to 26.7% (4/15) in the DRV/c group and remained 20% (3/15) in the control group at day 5. Fourteen days after randomization, 1 participant in the DRV/c group progressed to critical illness and discontinued DRV/c, while all the patients in the control group were stable (P = 1.0). The frequencies of adverse events in the 2 groups were comparable.                                                  Conclusions                   Five days of DRV/c did not increase the proportion of negative conversion vs standard of care alone, although it was well tolerated.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on patients ≥18 years reporting data on therapeutic interventions in SARS-CoV-2. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes were rates of mechanical ventilation, viral clearance, adverse events, discharge, and progression to severe disease. Pooled rates and odds ratios (OR) were calculated. Twenty-nine studies with 5207 patients were included. Pooled all-cause mortality in intervention arm was 12.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.1%-17.4%). Mortality was significantly higher for studies using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for intervention (OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.97-1.89). Adverse events were also higher in HCQ subgroup (OR: 3.88; 95% CI: 1.60-9.45). There was no difference in other secondary outcomes. There is a need for well-designed randomized clinical trials for further investigation of every therapeutic intervention for further insight into different therapeutic options.	32667699	Journal of medical virology	1096-9071	10.1002/jmv.26302

Governments have implemented lockdown measures, blocked international travel, and enforced other public containment measures to mitigate the virus morbidity and mortality. As of today, no drug has the power to fight the infection and bring normalcy to the utter chaos. This leaves us with only one choice namely an effective and safe vaccine that shall be manufactured as soon as possible and available to all countries and populations affected by the pandemic at an affordable price. There has been an unprecedented fast track path taken in Research & Development by the World community for developing an effective and safe vaccine. Platform technology has been exploited to develop candidate vaccines in a matter of days to weeks, and as of now, 108 such vaccines are available. Six of these vaccines have entered clinical trials. As clinical trials are "rate-limiting" and "time-consuming", many innovative methods are in practice for a fast track. These include parallel phase I-II trials and obtaining efficacy data from phase IIb trials. Human "challenge experiments" to confirm efficacy in humans is under serious consideration. The availability of the COVID-19 vaccine has become a race against time in the middle of death and devastation. There is an atmosphere of tremendous hype around the COVID-19 vaccine, and developers are using every moment to make claims, which remain unverified. However, concerns are raised about a rush to deploy a COVID-19 vaccine. Applying "Quick fix" and "short cuts" can lead to errors with disastrous consequences.	32837093	Journal of clinical and experimental hepatology	0973-6883	10.1016/j.jceh.2020.06.003
A Snapshot of the Global Race for Vaccines Targeting SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 Pandemic	https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00937/full	19/06/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.3389/fphar.2020.00937/full	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Vacina de DNA', 'Vacina de RNA']	['DNA vaccine', 'RNA vaccine']	A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has entered the human population and has spread rapidly around the world in the first half of 2020 causing a global pandemic. The virus uses its spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain to interact with host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) sites to initiate a cascade of events that culminate in severe acute respiratory syndrome in some individuals. In efforts to curtail viral spread, authorities initiated far-reaching lockdowns that have disrupted global economies. The scientific and medical communities are mounting serious efforts to limit this pandemic and subsequent waves of viral spread by developing preventative vaccines and repurposing existing drugs as potential therapies. In this review, we focus on the latest developments in COVID-19 vaccine development, including results of the first Phase I clinical trials and describe a number of the early candidates that are emerging in the field. We seek to provide a balanced coverage of the seven main platforms used in vaccine development that will lead to a desired target product profile for the "ideal" vaccine. Using tales of past vaccine discovery efforts that have taken many years or that have failed, we temper over exuberant enthusiasm with cautious optimism that the global medical community will reach the elusive target to treat COVID-19 and end the pandemic.	32636754	Frontiers in pharmacology	1663-9812	10.3389/fphar.2020.00937

In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in the utilization of MSCs in diverse clinical indications both in animal models and human clinical trials. However, the potential of MSCs to control or treat viral diseases is still in its infancy. In this study, we report quantitative data on the MSC-based clinical trials over the last ten years as they appear on the online database of clinical research studies from US National Institutes of Health. In particular, we provide comprehensive review of either completed or ongoing clinical trials using MSCs for virus-associated diseases focusing on HIV, hepatitis B virus and COVID-19 virus.	32616467	Current research in translational medicine	2452-3186	10.1016/j.retram.2020.04.003
Rethinking interleukin-6 blockade for treatment of COVID-19	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110053	27/06/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110053	0306-9877	03069877	MEDICAL HYPOTHESES	A4	0.569	94	3.3	-	['Inibidores de interleucina-6']	['Interleukin-6 inhibitors']	Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine with effects in immune regulation, inflammation, and infection. The use of drugs that inhibit IL-6 biological activity has been proposed as a treatment for patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rationale for this approach includes commitment to the concept that inflammation is a cause of lung damage in COVID-19 and belief that IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory molecule. Observational data thought to support IL-6 inhibition include elevated circulating IL-6 levels in COVID-19 patients and association between elevated IL-6 and poor clinical outcomes. However, IL-6 has significant anti-inflammatory properties, which calls into question the rationale for employing IL-6 blockade to suppress inflammation-induced tissue injury. Also, studies suggesting a beneficial role for IL-6 in the host response to infection challenge the strategy of using IL-6 blockade to treat COVID-19. In studies of recombinant IL-6 injected into human volunteers, IL-6 levels exceeding those measured in COVID-19 patients have been observed with no pulmonary adverse events or other organ damage. These observations question the role of IL-6 as a contributing factor in COVID-19. Clinical experience with IL-6 receptor antagonists such as tocilizumab demonstrates increase in severe and opportunistic infections, raising concern about using tocilizumab and similar agents to treat COVID-19. Trials of drugs to inhibit IL-6 activity in COVID-19 are ongoing and will shed light on the role of IL-6 in COVID-19 pathogenesis. However, until more information is available, providers should exercise caution in prescribing these therapies given the potential for patient harm.	32758889	Medical hypotheses	1532-2777	10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110053

The cause was identified as being a new virus, later named SARS-CoV-2. We can distinguish three clinical phases of the disease with a distinct pathogenesis, manifestations and prognosis. Here, we describe the case of a 45-year-old male, successfully treated for Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The patient was feeling sick in early April 2020; he had a fever and pharyngodynia. When he came to our COVID hospital, his breathing was normal. The nasopharyngeal swab specimen turned out positive. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed mild interstitial pneumonia. The patient was admitted to our department and treated with hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir, darunavir, azithromycin and enoxaparin. On day seven of the disease, the patient's respiratory condition got worse as he was developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was given tocilizumab and corticosteroids and was immediately treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV). His condition improved, and in the ensuing days, the treatment gradually switched to a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC); after 18 days, the patient's clinical condition was good.The successful results we have been able to obtain are closely associated with avoidance of invasive ventilation that may lead to intensive care unit (ICU)-related superinfections. In our opinion, it is fundamental to understand that COVID-19 is a systemic disease that is a consequence of an overwhelming inflammatory response, which can cause severe medical conditions, even in young patients.	32650356	Journal of population therapeutics and clinical pharmacology = Journal de la therapeutique des populations et de la pharmacologie clinique	2561-8741	10.15586/jptcp.v27iSP1.691

There have been concerns on whether alterations of ACE2 expression by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors would contribute to the infectivity and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We performed a case-control study to investigate the association between RAAS inhibitors and risk and severity of COVID-19 infection in South Korea using the population-based data provided by the Korean National Health Insurance System. Of 16 281 subjects with hypertension, there were 950 (5.8%) confirmed COVID-19 cases. After case-control matching, multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression analysis was performed. The adjusted odds ratio and 95% CIs for COVID-19 infection and long-term hospitalization comparing exposure to RAAS inhibitors and nonexposure to RAAS inhibitors was 1.161 (0.958–1.407) and 0.863 (0.533–1.397), respectively. When comparing exposure to RAAS inhibitors and nonexposure to RAAS inhibitors for intensive care unit admission, high-flow oxygen therapy, and death, the adjusted odds ratios (95% CIs) were 1.515 (0.402–5.701), 0.663 (0.272–1.619), and 1.363 (0.513–3.662), respectively. In all analyses,             P            values were not significant (             P            &gt;0.05). The present study demonstrates the absence of an identifiable association between the exposure to RAAS inhibitors and risk and severity of COVID-19 infection, supporting the current medical guidelines and recommendations that patients should not discontinue RAAS inhibitors out of a concern that they are at increased risk for infection or severe illness of COVID-19.

Clinical Features of COVID-19 in Patients With Essential Hypertension and the Impacts of Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone System Inhibitors on the Prognosis of COVID-19 Patients	https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15289	13/07/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15289	0194-911X	0194911X	HYPERTENSION (DALLAS, TEX. 1979)	A1	3.395	276	7.36	             Hypertension is one of the most common comorbidities in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to clarify the impact of hypertension on COVID-19 and investigate whether the prior use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors affects the prognosis of COVID-19. A total of 996 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled, including 282 patients with hypertension and 714 patients without hypertension. Propensity score-matched analysis (1:1 matching) was used to adjust the imbalanced baseline variables between the 2 groups. Patients with hypertension were further divided into the RAAS inhibitor group (n=41) and non-RAAS inhibitor group (n=241) according to their medication history. The results showed that COVID-19 patients with hypertension had more severe secondary infections, cardiac and renal dysfunction, and depletion of CD8             +            cells on admission. Patients with hypertension were more likely to have comorbidities and complications and were more likely to be classified as critically ill than those without hypertension. Cox regression analysis revealed that hypertension (hazard ratio, 95% CI, unmatched cohort [1.80, 1.20–2.70]; matched cohort [2.24, 1.36–3.70]) was independently associated with all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19. In addition, hypertensive patients with a history of RAAS inhibitor treatment had lower levels of C-reactive protein and higher levels of CD4             +            cells. The mortality of patients in the RAAS inhibitor group (9.8% versus 26.1%) was significantly lower than that of patients in the non-RAAS inhibitor group. In conclusion, hypertension may be an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19. Patients who previously used RAAS inhibitors may have a better prognosis.

To date, no specific drug for COVID-19 has been developed. Thus, this randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial (ChiCTR2000029853) was performed in China. A total of 20 mild and common COVID-19 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive azvudine and symptomatic treatment (FNC group), or standard antiviral and symptomatic treatment (control group). The mean times of the first nucleic acid negative conversion (NANC) of ten patients in the FNC group and ten patients in the control group are 2.60 (SD 0.97; range 1-4) d and 5.60 (SD 3.06; range 2-13) d, respectively (p = 0.008). The mean times of the first NANC of four newly diagnosed subjects in the FNC group and ten subjects in the control group are 2.50 (SD 1.00; range 2-4) d and 9.80 (SD 4.73; range 3-19) d, respectively (starting from the initial treatment) (p = 0.01). No adverse events occur in the FNC group, while three adverse events occur in the control group (p = 0.06). The preliminary results show that FNC treatment in the mild and common COVID-19 may shorten the NANC time versus standard antiviral treatment. Therefore, clinical trials of FNC treating COVID-19 with larger sample size are warranted.	35403380	Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)	2198-3844	10.1002/advs.202001435

We believe that anti-CD20 therapy may jeopardise the efficacy of such a vaccine. This is regrettable because patients receiving anti-CD20 therapy (i.e. those with haematologic malignancies or autoimmune disorders) are particularly at risk of severe COVID-19 and, as such, are the most in need of a vaccine. Here, we review the reasons why anti-CD20 therapy may abrogate or diminish the efficacy of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and we draw physicians' attention towards this potential risk so that it can be considered when evaluating the risk/benefit ratio of anti-CD20 therapy during the current pandemic.	32619884	European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)	1879-0852	10.1016/j.ejca.2020.06.017

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, a live-attenuated strain derived from an isolate of Mycobacterium bovis and originally designed to prevent tuberculosis, has shown some efficacy against infection with unrelated pathogens. In this study, we reviewed 120 consecutive adult patients (≥18 years old) with COVID-19 at a major federally qualified health centre in Rhode Island, United States from 19 March to 29 April 2020. Median age was 39.5 years (interquartile range, 27.0-50.0), 30% were male and 87.5% were Latino/Hispanics. Eighty-two (68.3%) patients had BCG vaccination. Individuals with BCG vaccination were less likely to require hospital admission during the disease course (3.7% vs. 15.8%, P = 0.019). This association remained unchanged after adjusting for demographics and comorbidities (P = 0.017) using multivariate regression analysis.

PRINT)	A1	3.218	185	8.76	 Abstract  Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is spreading worldwide. To date, no specific treatment has convincingly demonstrated its efficacy. Hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir have potential interest, but virological and clinical data are scarce, especially in critically ill patients.  Methods The present report took the opportunity of compassionate use and successive drug shortages to compare the effects of two therapeutic options, lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine, as compared to standard of care only. The primary outcomes were treatment escalation (intubation, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation support, or renal replacement therapy) after day 1 until day 28. Secondary outcomes included ventilator-free days at day 28, mortality at day 14 and day 28, treatment safety issues and changes in respiratory tracts, and plasma viral load (as estimated by cycle threshold value) between admission and day 7.  Results Eighty patients were treated during a 4-week period and included in the analysis: 22 (28%) received standard of care only, 20 (25%) patients received lopinavir/ritonavir associated to standard of care, and 38 (47%) patients received hydroxychloroquine and standard of care. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the 3 groups. Treatment escalation occurred in 9 (41%), 10 (50%), and 15 (39%) patients who received standard of care only, standard of care and lopinavir/ritonavir, and standard of care and hydroxychloroquine, respectively ( p = 0.567). There was no significant difference between groups regarding the number of ventilator-free days at day 28 and mortality at day 14 and day 28. Finally, there was no significant change between groups in viral respiratory or plasma load between admission and day 7.  Conclusion In critically ill patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia, no difference was found between hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir as compared to standard of care only on the proportion of patients who needed treatment escalation at day 28. Further randomized controlled trials are required to demonstrate whether these drugs may be useful in this context.

Therefore, chloroquine is considered as a treatment option for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Chloroquine is known for prolonging the QT interval, but limited data are available on the extent of this QT-prolonging effect.  Objective To assess the QTc-prolonging potential of chloroquine in COVID-19 patients and to evaluate whether this prolongation increases with the cumulative dose of chloroquine and is associated with the peak plasma concentration of chloroquine. Furthermore, the number of patients who prematurely discontinued treatment or had an adjustment in dose due to QTc-interval prolongation was established.  Methods A retrospective, observational study was performed in patients aged over 18 years, hospitalised for a suspected or proven infection with COVID-19, and therefore treated with chloroquine, with a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) performed prior to the start of treatment and at least one ECG after starting the treatment.  Results In total, 397 patients were included. The mean increase in QTc interval throughout the treatment with chloroquine was 33 ms. Nineteen out of 344 patients unnecessarily had their treatment prematurely discontinued or adjusted due to a prolonged QTc interval based on the computerised interpretation of the ECG.  Conclusion Chloroquine treatment in COVID-19 patients gradually increased the QTc interval.

It is a very complex systemic disease in terms of pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis. Pharmacological treatment may include antiviral and antimalarial drugs, antibiotics, monoclonal antibodies, corticosteroids as well as low-molecular-weight heparins to prevent the evolution of the disease from reaching the severe inflammatory phase that can lead to respiratory complications, multiple organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and finally death. Therefore, pending the development of the much sought-after vaccine, there needs to be a multidisciplinary approach to tackling this disease, and it is essential to use different medical treatments at the correct pathogenic moment. The aim of this article is to evaluate the rationale and reason behind the use of antirheumatic drugs, by expert point of view, in the various phases of the disease. Another important aspect in the management of the disease is to identify patients at high risk, both to change their lifestyle and to correct the state of their health through non-pharmacological measures for improving their immuno-balance. Our literature review reveals the important role and the therapeutic potential of antirheumatic agents in preventing the progression of the disease and aiding recovery from the disease. However, there is a lack of clinical evidence to support the use of these agents, indicating that further randomized controlled studies are required.	32650355	Journal of population therapeutics and clinical pharmacology = Journal de la therapeutique des populations et de la pharmacologie clinique	2561-8741	10.15586/jptcp.v27iSP1.689

The bacillus Calmette−Guérin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis also confers broad protection against other infectious diseases, and it has been proposed that it could reduce the severity of COVID-19. This epidemiological study assessed the global linkage between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality. Signals of BCG vaccination effect on COVID-19 mortality are influenced by social, economic, and demographic differences between countries. After mitigating multiple confounding factors, several significant associations between BCG vaccination and reduced COVID-19 deaths were observed. This study highlights the need for mechanistic studies behind the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19, and for clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of BCG vaccination to protect from severe COVID-19.

Clinical characteristics and predictors of survival in adults with coronavirus disease 2019 receiving tocilizumab	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102512	03/07/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102512	0896-8411	08968411	JOURNAL OF AUTOIMMUNITY (PRINT)	A1	2.751	121	12.06	-	['Tocilizumabe']	['Tocilizumab']	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can progress to cytokine storm that is associated with organ dysfunction and death. The purpose of the present study is to determine clinical characteristics associated with 28 day in-hospital survival in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that received tocilizumab. This was a retrospective observational cohort study conducted at a five hospital health system in Michigan, United States. Adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 that were admitted to the hospital and received tocilizumab for cytokine storm from March 1, 2020 through April 3, 2020 were included. Patients were grouped into survivors and non-survivors based on 28 day in-hospital mortality. Study day 0 was defined as the day tocilizumab was administered. Factors independently associated with in-hospital survival at 28 days after tocilizumab administration were assessed. Epidemiologic, demographic, laboratory, prognostic scores, treatment, and outcome data were collected and analyzed. Clinical response was collected and defined as a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status or discharged alive from the hospital. Of the 81 patients included, the median age was 64 (58-71) years and 56 (69.1%) were male. The 28 day in-hospital mortality was 43.2%. There were 46 (56.8%) patients in the survivors and 35 (43.2%) in the non-survivors group. On study day 0 no differences were noted in demographics, clinical characteristics, severity of illness scores, or treatments received between survivors and non-survivors. C-reactive protein was significantly higher in the non-survivors compared to survivors. Compared to non-survivors, recipients of tocilizumab within 12 days of symptom onset was independently associated with survival (adjusted OR: 0.296, 95% CI: 0.098-0.889). SOFA score ≥8 on day 0 was independently associated with mortality (adjusted OR: 2.842, 95% CI: 1.042-7.753). Clinical response occurred more commonly in survivors than non-survivors (80.4% vs. 5.7%; p < 0.001). Improvements in the six-point ordinal scale and SOFA score were observed in survivors after tocilizumab. Early receipt of tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19 was an independent predictor for in-hospital survival at 28 days.	32646770	Journal of autoimmunity	1095-9157	10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102512

Early use of tocilizumab in the prevention of adult respiratory failure in SARS-CoV-2 infections and the utilization of interleukin-6 levels in the management	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmv.26288	09/07/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1002/jmv.26288	0146-6615	01466615	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY (PRINT)	B1	2.656	137	14.76	-	['Tocilizumabe']	['Tocilizumab']	Respiratory failure in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection appears related to cytokine release syndrome that often results in mechanical ventilation (MV). We investigated the role of tocilizumab (TCZ) on interleukin-6 (IL-6) trends and MV in patients with SARS-CoV-2. In this longitudinal observational study, 112 patients were evaluated from 1 February to 31 May 2020. TCZ was administered followed by methylprednisolone to patients with >3L oxygen requirement and pneumonia severity index score ≤130 with computed tomography scan changes. IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and procalcitonin were monitored on days 0, 3, and 6 of therapy. Statistical analyses were performed with significance ≤0.05. Eighty out of 112 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (45 males, 56.96%; 34 females, 43.04%) were included in this study. Seven patients expired (8.75%) and nine patients required MV (11.25%). Median IL-6 levels pre-administration of TCZ was 342.50 (78.25-666.25) pg/mL compared with post-administration on day 3 (563; 162-783) pg/mL (P < .00001). On day 6, the median dropped to 545 (333.50-678.50) pg/mL compared with day 3 (P = .709). CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer levels were reduced after TCZ therapy. Early use of TCZ may reduce the need for MV and decrease CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer levels. The sequential use of methylprednisolone for 72 hours seems to potentiate the effect and prolong the suppression of the cytokine storm. IL-6 levels may be helpful as a prognostic tool.	32644254	Journal of medical virology	1096-9071	10.1002/jmv.26288

However, drug effectiveness in preventing, treating, or slowing the progression of the disease is still unknown. Despite some initial promising in vitro results, rigorous pre-clinical animal studies and randomized clinical trials have not been performed yet. On the other hand, while the potential effectiveness of CQ/HCQ is, at best, hypothetical, their side effects are factual and most worrisome, particularly when considering vulnerable groups of patients being treated with these drugs. in this comment, we briefly explain the possible mechanisms of action of CQ/HCQ for treating other diseases, possible actions against covid-19, and their potent side effects, in order to reinforce the necessity of evaluating the benefit-risk balance when widely prescribing these drugs for SARS-COV-2 infection/covid-19. We conclude by strongly recommending against their indiscriminate use.	32638884	Revista de saude publica	1518-8787	10.11606/s1518-8787.2020054002631

Treatment of severe COVID-19 with tocilizumab mitigates cytokine storm and averts mechanical ventilation during acute respiratory distress: a case report and literature review	https://doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed5030112	03/07/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.3390/tropicalmed5030112	2414-6366	24146366	TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE	C	0.924	24	3.61	 COVID-19, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China, in 2019 and has resulted in the current pandemic. The disease continues to pose a major therapeutic challenge. Patient mortality is ultimately caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Cytokine release syndrome (or “cytokine storm”) is likely to be a contributing factor to ARDS in many patients. Because interleukin 6 (IL-6) is known to play a key role in inflammation, IL-6 receptor inhibitors such as tocilizumab may potentially treat COVID-19 by attenuating cytokine release. We present the case of a 48-year-old male with severe COVID-19, on the verge of meeting intubation requirements, who needed progressive oxygen support for respiratory distress. The patient was treated with a non-weight-based dosage of tocilizumab to prevent the onset of a cytokine storm. We chose to administer an IL-6 inhibitor because of the gradually increasing levels of acute phase reactants identified on serial blood draws, as well as his declining respiratory status. The treatment was well-tolerated in conjunction with standard drug therapies for COVID-19 (hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and zinc). The patient subsequently experienced marked improvements in his respiratory symptoms and overall clinical status over the following days. We believe that tocilizumab played a substantial role in his ability to avert clinical decline, particularly the need for mechanical ventilation. Ultimately, the patient was downgraded from the ICU and discharged within days. We highlight the potential of IL-6 inhibitors to prevent the progression of respiratory disease to a point requiring ventilator support. This case underscores the potential importance of early serial measurements of IL-6 and cytokine storm-associated acute phase reactants, such as ferritin, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein, in guiding clinical decision-making in the management of patients with suspected COVID-19. Conclusion: The early, proactive identification of serum acute phase reactants should be implemented in the treatment of COVID-19 in order to screen for a primary contributor to mortality—the cytokine storm. This screening, when followed by aggressive early treatment for cytokine storm, may have optimal therapeutic benefits and obviate the need for mechanical ventilation, thereby decreasing mortality. Additionally, we review current evidence regarding cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 and the use of IL-6 receptor inhibition as a therapeutic strategy, and examine other reported cases in the literature describing IL-6 antagonist treatment for patients with COVID-19.

We observed no statistically significant differences in percentages of in-hospital mortality (28% vs. 34%, P = 0.46), ICU admission (20% vs. 28%, P = 0.37) or invasive mechanical ventilation (18% vs. 26%, P = 0.31) between patients with or without ACEI/ARB treatment. Further multivariable adjustment of age and gender did not provide evidence for a significant association between ACEI/ARB treatment and severe COVID-19 outcomes. Our findings confirm the lack of an association between chronic receipt of renin-angiotensin system antagonists and severe outcomes of COVID-19.

In the first phase, when the viral replication plays a pivotal pathogenetic role, antiviral drugs could be crucial in limiting viral-induced organ damage. Unfortunately, there are no specific antivirals of proven efficacy for COVID-19, and several drugs have been repurposed to face this dramatic pandemic. In this paper we review the studies evaluating lopinavir/ritonavir association (LPV/r) use in COVID-19, and previously in SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). We searched PubMed to identify all relevant clinical and laboratory studies published up to 15 May 2020; the guidelines on the use of LPV/r in COVID-19 were further directly searched on the website of the main international scientific societies and agencies. Available evidence is currently scarce and of low quality. The recommendations issued for COVID-19 vary from positions clearly against the use of LPV/r to other positions that are more favorable. In our opinion, despite the controversial results of an important randomized clinical trial, and some recommendations, clinicians should not abandon the use of LPV/r for the treatment of COVID-19, possibly using this drug inside a prospective randomized trial, waiting for the results of the numerous ongoing trials evaluating its efficacy.	32629768	Journal of clinical medicine	2077-0383	10.3390/jcm9072050

Since the patient refused admission to the hospital and had stable vital signs, we chose to treat him with a safe anti-inflammatory and non-immunosuppressive therapy. To hit two birds with one stone, we considered colchicine, as it has systemic anti-inflammatory effects and is also effective in gout flare. Unexpectedly, 48 hours after treatment, not only did his ongoing fever and toe pain disappear, he also had significant improvements in his general state of health and all his inflammatory markers including fibrinogen, ferritin, D-dimer, and IL-6 levels normalized. To our knowledge, the use of colchicine in Covid-19 and CRS has not been reported. This observation merits the consideration of colchicine as a safe, inexpensive and oral medication for the treatment of mild to moderate CRS in Covid-19 patients. More importantly, in Covid-19 patients with early lung involvement colchicine may be an appropriate candidate to prevent CRS in adjunction with routine antiviral agents.

However, effective treatments or vaccines are still not available. Although convalescent plasma (CP) therapy can be useful in the treatment of COVID-19, it has not been widely used in Korea because of the concerns about adverse effects and the difficulty in matching patients to donors. The use of ABO-incompatible plasma is not contraindicated in treatment, but can be hesitated due to the lack of experience of physicians. Here, we describe a 68-year old man with COVID-19 who was treated ABO-incompatible plasma therapy; additionally, we comment on the acute side effects associated with ABO mismatch transfusion. To overcome the obstacles of donor-recipient connections (schedule and distance), we propose the storage of frozen plasma, modification of the current Blood Management Law, and the establishment of a CP bank. We suggest that experience gained in CP therapy will be useful for not only the treatment of COVID-19, but also for coping with new emerging infectious diseases.	32627442	Journal of Korean medical science	1598-6357	10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e239

The majority of infected people presents flu like symptoms and among them 15-20% develops a severe interstitial pneumonitis (IP) that may eventually evolve in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). IP is caused by the viral glycoprotein spike (S) binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed on the surface of alveolar pneumocytes. The virus is recognized by the "pattern recognition receptors" (PRR) of the immune cells that release cytokines activating more immune cells that produce a large number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tissue factors and vasoactive peptides. Affected patients might develop the "cytokine storm syndrome," a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinaemia with multiorgan failure. In patients infected by SARS-COv-2 increase in T-helper 2 (TH2) cytokines (IL-4 and IL10) are reported in addition to the T-helper 1 (TH1) cytokines (IL1B, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1) previously detected in other coronavirus infections. Cytokines and other molecules involved in immune response and inflammation are conceivable therapeutic targets for IP and ARDS, improving symptoms and decreasing intensive care unit admissions. To this aim off label drugs may be used taking into consideration the window timing for immunosuppressive drugs in virus infected patients. Some off label therapeutic options and preclinical evidence drugs are herein considered.	32574268	Frontiers in immunology	1664-3224	10.3389/fimmu.2020.01201
Prophylactic (hydroxy)chloroquine in COVID-19: potential relevance for cardiac arrhythmia risk	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.07.001	02/07/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.07.001	1547-5271	15475271	HEART RHYTHM	A2	2.402	140	4.93	-	['Hidroxicloroquina']	['Hydroxychloroquine']	(Hydroxy)chloroquine ((H)CQ) is being investigated as a treatment for COVID-19, but studies have so far demonstrated either no or a small benefit. However, these studies have been mostly performed in patients admitted to the hospital and hence likely already (severely) affected. Another suggested approach uses prophylactic (H)CQ treatment aimed at preventing either severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection or the development of disease. A substantial number of clinical trials are planned or underway aimed at assessing the prophylactic benefit of (H)CQ. However, (H)CQ may lead to QT prolongation and potentially induce life-threatening arrhythmias. This may be of particular relevance to patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease and those taking other QT-prolonging drugs. In addition, it is known that a certain percentage of the population carries genetic variant(s) that reduces their repolarization reserve, predisposing them to (H)CQ-induced QT prolongation, and this may be more relevant to female patients who already have a longer QT interval to start with. This review provides an overview of the current evidence on (H)CQ therapy in patients with COVID-19 and discusses different strategies for prophylactic (H)CQ therapy (ie, preinfection, postexposure, and postinfection). In particular, the potential cardiac effects, including QT prolongation and arrhythmias, will be addressed. Based on these insights, recommendations will be presented as to which preventive measures should be taken when giving (H)CQ prophylactically, including electrocardiographic monitoring.	32622993	Heart rhythm	1556-3871	10.1016/j.hrthm.2020.07.001
Janus sword actions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine against COVID-19	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898656820301832	03/07/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898656820301832	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Cloroquina', 'Hidroxicloroquina']	['Chloroquine', 'Hydroxychloroquine']	Chloroquine (CQ) and its analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been thrust into our everyday vernacular because some believe, based on very limited basic and clinical data, that they might be helpful in preventing and/or lessening the severity of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, lacking is a temperance in enthusiasm for their possible use as well as sufficient perspective on their effects and side-effects. CQ and HCQ have well-known properties of being diprotic weak bases that preferentially accumulate in acidic organelles (endolysosomes and Golgi apparatus) and neutralize luminal pH of acidic organelles. These primary actions of CQ and HCQ are responsible for their anti-malarial effects; malaria parasites rely on acidic digestive vacuoles for survival. Similarly, de-acidification of endolysosomes and Golgi by CQ and HCQ may block severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) integration into host cells because SARS-CoV-2 may require an acidic environment for its entry and for its ability to bud and infect bystander cells. Further, de-acidification of endolysosomes and Golgi may underly the immunosuppressive effects of these two drugs. However, modern cell biology studies have shown clearly that de-acidification results in profound changes in the structure, function and cellular positioning of endolysosomes and Golgi, in signaling between these organelles and other subcellular organelles, and in fundamental cellular functions. Thus, studying the possible therapeutic effects of CQ and HCQ against COVID-19 must occur concurrent with studies of the extent to which these drugs affect organellar and cell biology. When comprehensively examined, a better understanding of the Janus sword actions of these and other drugs might yield better decisions and better outcomes.	32629149	Cellular signalling	1873-3913	10.1016/j.cellsig.2020.109706

The spectrum of the disease varies from mild asymptomatic infection to severe disease with rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. It is associated with a prothrombotic state and hence there is a risk of thromboembolic complications in critically ill patients, even after recovery. However, the duration of prothrombotic risk after recovery is yet to be determined. We present the case of a 78-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation on warfarin who had been recently discharged to a nursing home after recovering from COVID-19 pneumonia and presented to the emergency department a month later with worsening shortness of breath and cough. He was found to have worsening respiratory failure with multiple segmental pulmonary emboli, despite being on warfarin, and supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR). He required mechanical ventilation and was started on steroids and therapeutic enoxaparin anticoagulation. This case highlights the risk of delayed thromboembolic complications in patients with COVID-19 infection and the need to identify the subgroup of patients with a higher risk of thromboembolism, such as discharges to nursing homes and those in need of oxygen requirement; and those with underlying comorbid conditions that may require anticoagulation for a longer duration. The role of heparin is being increasingly investigated in patients with COVID-19 infection; however, the role of other anticoagulants such as warfarin is yet to be defined.	32617244	Cureus	2168-8184	10.7759/cureus.8847

Infectivity was higher in patients that had underlying co morbid disease, especially in patients with multiple co morbid conditions. Symptomatic presentation of COVID-19 was observed to be higher in patients with co morbid disease. Average recovery time from COVID-19 was 8 days with effective treatment. Mortality in COVID-19 was higher in old age population, male gender, symptomatic and co morbid patients as compared to other similarly matched group.

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in blood plasma and the lower and upper respiratory tract. Among the five patients treated, two needed mechanical ventilation and one needed high-flow cannula oxygen. A significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract was observed in most cases, but two patients died with active SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lower respiratory tract. Plasma samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in only one patient. Remdesivir was interrupted before the initialy planned duration in four patients, two because of alanine aminotransferase elevations (3 to 5 normal range) and two because of renal failure requiring renal replacement. This case series of five COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit treatment for respiratory distress and treated with remdesivir, highlights the complexity of remdesivir use in such critically ill patients.	32619764	International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases	1878-3511	10.1016/j.ijid.2020.06.093

However, little is known about whether coinfection with influenza contributes to severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, and the optimal therapeutic strategy for these patients. We retrospectively studied 128 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients were positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive by nucleic acid detection. Sixty-four cases were coinfected with influenza A/B and the other 64 were influenza negative, matched by age, sex, and days from onset of symptoms. Among the 64 coinfected patients, 54 (84.4%) were coinfected with influenza A, and 10 (15.6%) with influenza B. The median duration of viral shedding time from admission was longer for patients with influenza coinfection (17.0 days) than for those without influenza coinfection (12.0 days) (P < .001). The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model showed that the hazards ratio of resolution in lung involvement was 1.878 (P = .020) for patients administered lopinavir/ritonavir, compared with those not administered lopinavir/ritonavir (95% confidence interval: 1.103-3.196). Among influenza coinfected patients, those treated with lopinavir/ritonavir exhibited faster pneumonia resolution within 2 weeks after symptom onset (37% vs 1%; P = .001). There was no difference in lung involvement between influenza coinfected and noninfected groups. Lopinavir/ritonavir eliminated the difference of lung involvement between influenza coinfected and noninfected groups, indicating that lopinavir/ritonavir is associated with pneumonia resolution in COVID-19.	32621621	Journal of medical virology	1096-9071	10.1002/jmv.26260

The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has unleashed a pandemic in record time accompanied by an alarming mortality rate mainly due to pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Because there are no effective preventive or curative therapies currently, MSC therapy (MSCT) has emerged as a possible candidate despite the lack of preclinical data of MSCs for COVID-19. Interestingly, MSCT preclinical data specifically on immune/inflammatory disorders of the lungs were among the earliest to be reported in 2003, with the first clinical use of MSCT for graft-vs-host disease reported in 2004. Since these first reports, preclinical data showing beneficial effects of MSC immunomodulation have accumulated substantially, and as a consequence, over a third of MSCT clinical trials now target immune/inflammatory diseases. There is much preclinical evidence for MSCT in noninfectious—including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis—as well as infectious bacterial immune/inflammatory lung disorders, with data generally demonstrating therapeutic effects; however, for infectious viral pulmonary conditions, the preclinical evidence is more scarce with some inconsistent outcomes. In this article, we review the mechanistic evidence for clinical use of MSCs in pulmonary immune/inflammatory disorders, and survey the ongoing clinical trials—including for COVID-19—of MSCT for these diseases, with some perspectives and comment on MSCT for COVID-19.                                  <jats:title />               	['Terapia celular']	['Cell Therapy']	The broad immunomodulatory properties of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have allowed for wide application in regenerative medicine as well as immune/inflammatory diseases, including unmatched allogeneic use.

It is highly effective against many microorganisms including some viruses. In this comprehensive systematic review, antiviral effects of ivermectin are summarized including in vitro and in vivo studies over the past 50 years. Several studies reported antiviral effects of ivermectin on RNA viruses such as Zika, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Hendra, Newcastle, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, chikungunya, Semliki Forest, Sindbis, Avian influenza A, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome, Human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Furthermore, there are some studies showing antiviral effects of ivermectin against DNA viruses such as Equine herpes type 1, BK polyomavirus, pseudorabies, porcine circovirus 2, and bovine herpesvirus 1. Ivermectin plays a role in several biological mechanisms, therefore it could serve as a potential candidate in the treatment of a wide range of viruses including COVID-19 as well as other types of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses.

A 58-year-old 2 years post-kidney transplant recipient, with maintenance immunosuppression of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisolone, presented with acute diarrhea which followed by fever on day 12. Symptoms of pneumonia together with lymphopenia from complete blood count were developed on day 7 after onset of fever with the x-ray finding of bilateral multifocal patchy infiltration. COVID-19 infection has been confirmed by reverse real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in nasal swab as well as found in stool. Darunavir together with ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and favipiravir was initiated on the first day of admission at primary hospital. Patient has been transferred to our hospital on day 2 of admission in which tacrolimus together with MMF was discontinued. High-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was required on days 4-5 of hospitalization. Tocilizumab was administered after rising of serum IL-6 level. Symptoms of pneumonia were improved in which no oxygen treatment required from day 10 of hospitalization. Drug interaction between tacrolimus and anti-viral treatment leads to severely high level of tacrolimus which caused reversible acute kidney injury (AKI) after supportive treatment.	32585765	Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society	1399-3062	10.1111/tid.13388

Auxiliary role of mesenchymal stem cells as regenerative medicine soldiers to attenuate inflammatory processes of severe acute respiratory infections caused by COVID-19	https://www.x-mol.com/paper/1276244658808713216	25/06/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://www.x-mol.com/paper/1276244658808713216	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Terapia celular']	['Cell Therapy']	Acute respiratory infections as one of the most common problems of healthcare systems also can be considered as an important reason for worldwide morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases. Coronaviruses are a group of well-known respiratory viruses that can cause acute respiratory infections. At the current state, the 2019 novel coronavirus is cited as the most worldwide problematic agent for the respiratory system. According to investigations, people with old age and underlying diseases are at higher risk of 2019 novel coronavirus infection. Indeed, they may show a severe form of the disease (with severe acute respiratory infections). Based on the promising role of cell therapy and regenerative medicine approaches in the treatment of several life-threatening diseases, it seems that applying cell-based approaches can also be a hopeful strategy for improving subjects with severe acute respiratory infections caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus. Herein, due to the amazing effects of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of various diseases, this review focuses on the auxiliary role of mesenchymal stem cells to reduce inflammatory processes of acute respiratory infections caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus.	32588163	Cell and tissue banking	1573-6814	10.1007/s10561-020-09842-3
A brief review of interplay between vitamin D and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2: Implications for a potential treatment for COVID-19	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32584474	25/06/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32584474	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Vitamina D (25-hidroxivitamina D)']	['Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D)']	The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly expanding and causing many deaths all over the world with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring a pandemic in March 2020. Current therapeutic options are limited and there is no registered and/or definite treatment or vaccine for this disease or the causative infection, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a part of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), serves as the major entry point into cells for SARS-CoV-2 which attaches to human ACE2, thereby reducing the expression of ACE2 and causing lung injury and pneumonia. Vitamin D, a fat-soluble-vitamin, is a negative endocrine RAS modulator and inhibits renin expression and generation. It can induce ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis activity and inhibits renin and the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis, thereby increasing expression and concentration of ACE2, MasR and Ang-(1-7) and having a potential protective role against acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, targeting the unbalanced RAS and ACE2 down-regulation with vitamin D in SARS-CoV-2 infection is a potential therapeutic approach to combat COVID-19 and induced ARDS.	32584474	Reviews in medical virology	1099-1654	10.1002/rmv.2119

However, few studies reported the impacts of COVID-19 on liver function in patients with chronic liver diseases. We aimed to describe a case series of COVID-19 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 patients from hospitals in 10 cities of Jiangsu province, China, were retrospectively included between 18 January 2020 and 26 February 2020. Demographic information, epidemiologic data, clinical features, and treatment data were extracted from medical records. Seven COVID-19 patients with chronic HBV infection were included. Six (85.7%) patients were male. The patients aged from 33 to 49 years. Two patients had HBV-related cirrhosis. One patient (14.3%) was positive for serum HBV e-antigen. On admission, 1 (14.3%) patient had mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level (>40 U/L) and 1 (14.3%) had elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level (>40 U/L). The serum albumin level and platelet counts were decreased in two patients with HBV-related liver cirrhosis. Three (42.9%) patients had elevated ALT level and 2 (28.6%) patients had elevated AST level in hospitalization. However, the peak ALT and AST level during hospitalization was 51 U/L and 44 U/L, respectively. As of 29 February 2020, all patients were discharged. No patient was admitted to the intensive care units or developed liver failure during hospitalization. The abnormalities of liver function are not uncommon on COVID-19 patients with chronic HBV infection in our case series. However, no patient developed severe liver-related complications during hospitalization.	32593180	British journal of haematology	1365-2141	10.1111/bjh.16981

Clinical Implications of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine Ototoxicity for COVID-19 Treatment: A Mini-Review	https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00252	29/06/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00252	2296-2565	22962565	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH	A3	1.298	64	5.87	-	['Cloroquina', 'Hidroxicloroquina']	['Chloroquine', 'Hydroxychloroquine']	At this time of the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially effective treatments are currently under urgent investigation. Benefits of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 infection have been proposed and clinical trials are underway. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, typically used for the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases, have been considered for off-label use in several countries. In the literature, there are reports of ototoxic effects of the drugs causing damage to the inner ear structures, which then result in hearing loss, tinnitus, and/or imbalance. This mini-review represents a summary of the findings from a systematic search regarding ototoxicity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the published literature. The characteristics of sensorineural hearing loss and/or tinnitus after chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine treatment can be temporary but reports of persistent auditory and vestibular dysfunction exist. These are not frequent, but the impact can be substantial. Additionally, abnormal cochleovestibular development in the newborn was also reported after chloroquine treatment in pregnant women. The suggested dose of chloroquine for COVID-19 infection is considerably higher than the usual dosage for malaria treatment; therefore, it is plausible that the ototoxic effects will be greater. There are potential implications from this review for survivors of COVID-19 treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Patient reports of hearing loss, tinnitus, or imbalance should be noted. Those with troublesome hearing loss, tinnitus and/or imbalance are encouraged to be referred for hearing evaluation and interventions once they are stable. Clinical trials of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine should also consider including audiological monitoring in the protocol.	32574312	Frontiers in public health	2296-2565	10.3389/fpubh.2020.00252

Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of cytokine storm associated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. Here we examined compassionate use of tocilizumab in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.                                                  Methods                   We report on a single-center study of tocilizumab in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. All patients had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and oxygen saturations &amp;lt;90% on oxygen support with most intubated. We examined clinical and laboratory parameters including oxygen and vasopressor requirements, cytokine profiles, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels pre- and post-tocilizumab treatment.                                                  Results                   Twenty-seven SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients received one 400 mg dose of tocilizumab. Interleukin (IL)-6 was the predominant cytokine detected at tocilizumab treatment. Significant reductions in temperature and CRP were seen post-tocilizumab. However, 4 patients did not show rapid CRP declines, of whom 3 had poorer outcomes. Oxygen and vasopressor requirements diminished over the first week post-tocilizumab. Twenty-two patients required mechanical ventilation; at last follow-up, 16 were extubated. Adverse events and serious adverse events were minimal, but 2 deaths (7.4%) occurred that were felt unrelated to tocilizumab.                                                  Conclusions                   Compared to published reports on the morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2, tocilizumab appears to offer benefits in reducing inflammation, oxygen requirements, vasopressor support, and mortality. The rationale for tocilizumab treatment is supported by detection of IL-6 in pathogenic levels in all patients. Additional doses of tocilizumab may be needed for those showing slow declines in CRP. Proof of efficacy awaits randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials.               	['Tocilizumabe']	['Tocilizumab']	-	-	-	-	-

Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were reviewed against periods of bradycardia in each patient. The patient group comprised two males and two females. Two patients had pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities but no history of arrythmias. Heart rates ranged between 66 and 88 beats/min on admission. The lowest rates during bradycardia were between 42 and 49 beats/min. The onset of sinus bradycardia in patients 1, 2, and 3 were day nine, 15, and five of illness, respectively. Patient 4 had three episodes of bradycardia, starting on day 10 of illness. Patients' bradycardia episodes lasted one to 14 days. During bradycardia, maximum body temperatures ranged between 99.9 and 100.2 degree Fahrenheit. Patients 2, 3, and 4 required vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg during episodes. All four patients were on propofol at some point during bradycardia with patients 1, 2, and 3 also receiving dexmedetomidine. There was no consistent correlation of these medications with bradycardia. Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings included sinus bradycardia. Prolonged QTc interval observed in patient 2 on admission improved during bradycardia. Transient sinus bradycardia is a possible manifestation of COVID-19 and is important for close CV surveillance. Etiology can be multifactorial, but severe hypoxia, inflammatory damage of cardiac pacemaker cells, and exaggerated response to medications are possible triggers. High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines may act directly on the sinoatrial (SA) node contributing to the development of bradycardia. This may be a warning sign of the onset of a serious cytokine storm. An increased awareness of possible exaggerated bradycardia response is important to consider with the use of empiric medications which have arrhythmogenic effects.	32550090	Cureus	2168-8184	10.7759/cureus.8599

We examined factors that influence MMc detection and level across infancy and the effect of MMc on T cell responses to bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination in a cohort of HIV-exposed, uninfected and HIV-unexposed infants in South Africa. MMc was measured in whole blood from 58 infants using a panel of quantitative PCR assays at day 1, and 7, 15, and 36 weeks of life. Infants received BCG at birth, and selected whole blood samples from infancy were stimulated in vitro with BCG and assessed for polyfunctional CD4+ T cell responses. MMc was present in most infants across infancy, with levels ranging from 0 to 1,193/100,000 genomic equivalents and was positively impacted by absence of maternal HIV, maternal and infant HLA compatibility, infant female sex, and exclusive breastfeeding. Initiation of maternal antiretroviral therapy prior to pregnancy partially restored MMc level in HIV-exposed, uninfected infants. Birth MMc was associated with an improved polyfunctional CD4+ T cell response to BCG. These data emphasize that both maternal and infant factors influence the level of MMc, which may subsequently affect infant T cell responses.	32563675	European urology focus	2405-4569	10.1016/j.euf.2020.05.019
Non-optimal effectiveness of convalescent plasma transfusion and hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19: a case report.	https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-01354-6	19/06/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1186/s12985-020-01354-6	1743-422X	1743422X	VIROLOGY JOURNAL	A3	1.091	88	4.9	 Abstract  Background Convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion was reported to be effective in treating critically ill patients with COVID-19, and hydroxychloroquine could potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Herein, we reported a case receiving combination therapy with CP transfusion and hydroxychloroquine for the first time.  Case presentation Laboratory findings showed high lactic acid level (2.1 mmol/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP, 48.8 mg/L), and low white blood cell count (1.96 × 10 9/L) in a 65-year-old Chinese man, who was diagnosed with severe COVID-19. CP was intravenously given twice, and hydroxychloroquine was orally administrated for a week (0.2 g, three times a day). The lactic acid and C-reactive protein levels remained high (2.1 mmol/L and 73.23 mg/L, respectively), while the arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation decreased to 86% with a low oxygenation index (OI, 76 mmHg) on day 4 after CP transfusion. His temperature returned to normal and the OI ascended above 300 on day 11. Moreover, the RNA test remained positive in throat swab, and computed tomography revealed severe pulmonary lesions on day 11 after admission.  Conclusion These findings suggested that the effectiveness of combination therapy with CP and hydroxychloroquine may be non-optimal, and specific therapy needs to be explored.

Vaccine development and therapeutic design for 2019‐ncov/SARS‐cov‐2: challenges and chances.	https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.29771	18/06/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1002/jcp.29771	0021-9541	00219541	JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY (PRINT)	A2	1.308	183	6.77	-	['Vacina']	['Vaccine']	The ongoing outbreak of the recently emerged 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV), which has seriously threatened global health security, is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with high morbidity and mortality. Despite the burden of the disease worldwide, still, no licensed vaccine or any specific drug against 2019-nCoV is available. Data from several countries show that few repurposed drugs using existing antiviral drugs have not (so far) been satisfactory and more recently were proven to be even highly toxic. These findings underline an urgent need for preventative and therapeutic interventions designed to target specific aspects of 2019-nCoV. Again the major factor in this urgency is that the process of data acquisition by physical experiment is time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Scientific simulations and more in-depth data analysis permit to validate or refute drug repurposing opportunities predicted via target similarity profiling to speed up the development of a new more effective anti-2019-nCoV therapy especially where in vitro and/or in vivo data are not yet available. In addition, several research programs are being developed, aiming at the exploration of vaccines to prevent and treat the 2019-nCoV. Computational-based technology has given us the tools to explore and identify potentially effective drug and/or vaccine candidates which can effectively shorten the time and reduce the operating cost. The aim of the present review is to address the available information on molecular determinants in disease pathobiology modules and define the computational approaches employed in systematic drug repositioning and vaccine development settings for SARS-CoV-2.	32557648	Journal of cellular physiology	1097-4652	10.1002/jcp.29771

Systematic review of registered trials of Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis for COVID-19 health-care workers at the first third of 2020.	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100141	19/06/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100141	2352-7714	23527714	ONE HEALTH	A4	1.149	29	7.65	-	['Hidroxicloroquina']	['Hydroxychloroquine']	In the absence of a vaccine the medical and scientific community is looking intensely at utilizing a pre or post exposure drug that could decrease viremia. The search for a medication that could reduce risk of serious disease, and ideally of any manifestation of disease from SARS-CoV2, and of asymptomatic shedding of SARS-CoV2 is of urgent interest. Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals is among the approaches to achieve these ends. We performed a systematic review of all interventional studies registered in ClinicalTrials.gov with a focus on one repurposed drug, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The detailed analysis of these studies, some of them already recruiting, provide an overall picture of HCQ use as a COVID-19 prophylaxis around the world. Among the included studies, all but three were randomized and parallel and most of them (74%, 23/31) were double-blinded to quadruple-blinded studies. We found a great diversity in dosing and nearly all the possible scientifically reasonable regimens are under evaluation. This diversity offers benefits as well as challenges. Importantly, the final analysis of these trials should be done through an extensive reading of the results in regard to the clinical design, it will be crucial to carefully read and evaluate the results of each study in regards to the clinical design rather than quickly glancing a 140 characters-based social media message announcing the failure or success of a drug against a disease.	32562480	One health (Amsterdam, Netherlands)	2352-7714	10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100141

While studies are mixed on this topic, the therapeutic effect of HCQ or CQ still need more valid clinical evidence. In this descriptive observational study, we aimed to discuss the treatment response of HCQ in COVID-19 infected patients and 30 cases were included. The demographic, treatment, laboratory parameters of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) before and after HCQ therapy and clinical outcome in the 30 patients with COVID-19 were assessed. To evaluate the effect of mediation time point, we also divided these cases into two groups, patients began administrated with HCQ within 7 days hospital (defined as early delivery group) and 7 days after hospital (defined as later delivery group). We found that, the elevated IL-6, a risk factor in severe patients were reduced to normal level after HCQ treatment. More importantly, patients treated with HCQ at the time of early hospital recovered faster than those who treated later or taken as second line choose for their obvious shorter hospitalization time. In summary, early use of HCQ was better than later use and the effect of IL-6 and CRP level cannot be ruled out.	32779755	Journal of medical virology	1096-9071	10.1002/jmv.26193

The comparison of the effectiveness of lincocin® and azitro® in the treatment of covid-19-associated pneumonia: A prospective study.	https://jptcp.com/index.php/jptcp/article/view/684	03/06/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://jptcp.com/index.php/jptcp/article/view/684	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Azitromicina', 'Lincocin']	['Azithromycin', 'Lincocin']	The COVID-19 virus has spread rapidly around the world and there are many patients in multiple countries. Great efforts have been made to find effective medications against the COVID-19. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of LINCOCIN® and AZITRO® in the treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. A total of 24 hospitalized patients aged between 30-80 years who were admitted to the Tarsus Medical Park Hospital between February to March 2020 was included in the study. The patients were divided into LINCOCIN® and AZITRO® treatment groups. Bronchoalveolar-lavage PCR results were compared after treatment. The mean age was 58.4±15.4 years in the LINCOCIN® group and 59.1±16.6 years in the AZITRO® group. In the LINCOCIN® group, the rate of males was 66.7% and it was 58.3% in the AZITRO® group. There were no statistical differences in terms of age and gender between the groups. On the 6th day after starting treatment, negative bronchoalveolar PCR result was 83.3% in the LINCOCIN® group and 33.3% in the AZITRO® group. The negative bronchoalveolar PCR proportion was significantly higher in the LINCOCIN® group than in the AZITRO® group. LINCOCIN® usage may be more appropriate in the treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. Further studies with a large sample size should clarify these results.	32543164	Journal of population therapeutics and clinical pharmacology = Journal de la therapeutique des populations et de la pharmacologie clinique	2561-8741	10.15586/jptcp.v27iSP1.684

Now COVID-19 has been spread all over the world and declared epidemics by WHO. It has caused a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Due to the rapid increase of SARS-CoV-2 infections and unavailability of antiviral therapeutic agents, developing an effective SAR-CoV-2 vaccine is urgently required. SARS-CoV-2 which is genetically similar to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an enveloped, single and positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome comprising 29,891 nucleotides, which encode the 12 putative open reading frames responsible for the synthesis of viral structural and nonstructural proteins which are very similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV proteins. In this review we have summarized various vaccine candidates i.e., nucleotide, subunit and vector based as well as attenuated and inactivated forms, which have already been demonstrated their prophylactic efficacy against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, so these candidates could be used as a potential tool for the development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.	32535078	Life sciences	1879-0631	10.1016/j.lfs.2020.117956

Macrolides and viral infections: focus on azithromycin in COVID-19 pathology.	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106053	10/06/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106053	0924-8579	09248579	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS (PRINT)	A1	2.121	137	10.76	-	['Azitromicina']	['Azithromycin']	The emergence of the new COVID-19 virus is proving to be a challenge in seeking effective therapies. Since the most severe clinical manifestation of COVID-19 appears to be a severe acute respiratory syndrome, azithromycin has been proposed as a potential treatment. Azithromycin is known to have immunomodulating and antiviral properties. In vitro studies have demonstrated the capacity of azithromycin in reducing production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8, IL-6, TNF alpha, reduce oxidative stress, and modulate T-helper functions. At the same time there are multiple clinical evidences of the role of azithromycin in acute respiratory distress syndrome and against Middle East Respiratory syndrome (MERS). Some preliminary evidence has demonstrated controversial results regarding efficacy of azithromycin in combination with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19. First, a French trial demonstrated 100% virological negativizing of six patients treated with azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine vs. 57.1% of patients treated with only hydroxychloroquine and 12.5% of the control group (P < 0.05). On the other hand, another case series revealed no efficacy at all on 11 patients treated with the same combination and doses. Furthermore, there are some concerns regarding the association of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine because of potential QT prolongation. In fact, both drugs have this as a potential side effect and evidence regarding the safe use of this combination is controversial. Despite the necessity to quickly find solutions for COVID-19, extreme caution must be used in evaluating the risk-benefit balance. However, based on preclinical and clinical evidence and some preliminary results in COVID-19, azithromycin could have potential in the fight against this new disease.	32534189	International journal of antimicrobial agents	1872-7913	10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106053

To date, little is known about the viral shedding duration, clinical course and treatment efficacy of COVID-19 near Hubei Province, China. This multicentre, retrospective study was performed in 12 hospitals in Henan and Shaanxi Provinces from 20 January to 8 February 2020. Clinical outcomes were followed up until 26 March 2020. The viral shedding duration, full clinical course and treatment efficacy were analysed in different subgroups of patients. A total of 149 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. The median age was 42 years, and 61.1% (91) were males. Of them, 133 (89.3%) had fever, 131 of 144 (91%) had pneumonia, 27 (18.1%) required intensive care unit (ICU) management, 3 (2%) were pregnant, and 3 (2%) died. Two premature newborns were negative for SARS-CoV-2. In total, the median SARS-CoV-2 shedding period and clinical course were 12 (IQR: 9-17; mean: 13.4, 95% CI: 12.5, 14.2) and 20 (IQR: 16-24; mean: 21.2, 95% CI: 20.1, 22.3) days, respectively, and ICU patients had longer median viral shedding periods (21 [17-24] versus 11 [9-15]) and clinical courses (30 [22-33] vs. 19 [15.8-22]) than non-ICU patients (both p < .0001). SARS-CoV-2 clearances occurred at least 2 days before fatality in 3 non-survivors. Current treatment with any anti-viral agent or combination did not present the benefit of shortening viral shedding period and clinical course (all p > .05) in real-life settings. In conclusion, the viral shedding duration and clinical course in Henan and Shaanxi Provinces were shorter than those in Hubei Province, and current anti-viral therapies were ineffective for shortening viral shedding duration and clinical course in real-world settings. These findings expand our knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and may be helpful for management of the epidemic outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide. Further studies concerning effective anti-viral agents and vaccines are urgently needed.	32531138	Transboundary and emerging diseases	1865-1682	10.1111/tbed.13674

However, outcomes remain poor. Given the likely benefit of cyclosporine because of its antiviral and immunomodulatory effect, we have been using it as a strategy in KTRs diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We studied 29 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) who were admitted to our institution with COVID-19 between March 15and April, 24, 2020. Mycophenolate and/or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) were discontinued in all patients. Two therapeutic strategies were compared: Group 1, minimization of calcineurin inhibitors (N = 6); and Group 2, cyclosporine-based therapy (N = 23), with 15 patients switched from tacrolimus. Hydroxychloroquine was considered in both strategies but antivirals in none. Six patients died after respiratory distress (20.6%). Five required mechanical ventilation (17.2%), and 3 could be weaned. Nineteen patients had an uneventful recovery (65.5%). In group 1, 3 of 6 patients died (50%) and 1 of 6 required invasive mechanical ventilation (16.7%). In group 2, 3 of 23 patients died (12.5%). Renal function did not deteriorate and signs of rejection were not observed in any patient on the second treatment regime. In conclusion, immunosuppressant treatment based on cyclosporine could be safe and effective for KTRs diagnosed with COVID-19.	32529737	American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons	1600-6143	10.1111/ajt.16141

New treatment options for patients with severe symptoms and ways of reducing transmission in the community are taken into consideration. A retrospective study was conducted in the Department of Infectious Diseases of Alexandroupolis (Greece) including 16 patients with CoVID-19. They were classified into two groups, A and B. Group A received lopinavir/ritonavir as a third agent in the antiviral regimen, while group B did not. Lymphocytes were more significantly increased in patients of group A. Ferritin serum levels were also decreased significantly in these patients. Number of days needed for a first negative result of Real Time- Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was lower for Group A. The present study suggests that lopinavir/ritonavir may reduce the viral carriage in a shorter period of time compared with other antiviral regimens. Further studies are needed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir in the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.	32530369	Journal of chemotherapy (Florence, Italy)	1973-9478	10.1080/1120009X.2020.1775424

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy may be an potential alternative strategy for treating ARDS by targeting the various pathophysiological events of ARDS. By releasing a variety of paracrine factors and extracellular vesicles, MSC can exert anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-microbial, and pro-angiogenic effects, promote bacterial and alveolar fluid clearance, disrupt the pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cell damage, eventually avoiding the lung and distal organ injuries to rescue patients with ARDS. An increasing number of experimental animal studies and early clinical studies verify the safety and efficacy of MSC therapy in ARDS. Since low cell engraftment and survival in lung limit MSC therapeutic potentials, several strategies have been developed to enhance their engraftment in the lung and their intrinsic, therapeutic properties. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the mechanisms and optimization of MSC therapy in ARDS and highlighted the potentials and possible barriers of MSC therapy for COVID-19 patients with ARDS.

LUNG CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY	A1	1.639	169	5.36	  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the clinical syndrome associated with infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has impacted nearly every country in the world. Despite an unprecedented focus of scientific investigation, there is a paucity of evidence-based pharmacotherapies against this disease. Because of this lack of data-driven treatment strategies, broad variations in practice patterns have emerged. Observed hypercoagulability in patients with COVID-19 has created debate within the critical care community on the therapeutic utility of heparin. We seek to provide an overview of the data supporting the therapeutic use of heparin, both unfractionated and low molecular weight, as an anticoagulant for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we review preclinical evidence establishing biological plausibility for heparin and synthetic heparin-like drugs as therapies for COVID-19 through antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. Finally, we discuss known adverse effects and theoretical off-target effects that may temper enthusiasm for the adoption of heparin as a therapy in COVID-19 without confirmatory prospective randomized controlled trials. Despite previous failures of anticoagulants in critical illness, plausibility of heparin for COVID-19 is sufficiently robust to justify urgent randomized controlled trials to determine the safety and effectiveness of this therapy. 	['Heparina']	['Heparin']	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the clinical syndrome associated with infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has impacted nearly every country in the world. Despite an unprecedented focus of scientific investigation, there is a paucity of evidence-based pharmacotherapies against this disease. Because of this lack of data-driven treatment strategies, broad variations in practice patterns have emerged.

All four patients experienced significant improvement in objective and symptomatic disease measures after one day of high dose therapy suggesting that zinc therapy was playing a role in clinical recovery. A mechanism for zinc's effects is proposed based on previously published studies on SARS- CoV-1, and randomized controlled trials assessing zinc shortening of common cold duration. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the effectiveness of zinc as a treatment for COVID-19 but suggest the variables to be addressed to confirm these initial findings in future trials.	32522597	International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases	1878-3511	10.1016/j.ijid.2020.06.006

Despite the severity of some cases, there are no current pathogen-specific antivirals available to treat the disease. Therefore, many studies have focused on the evaluation of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of clinically available drugs. Here, we conducted a systematic review to describe the drug repositioning strategy against SARS-CoV-2 and to discuss the clinical impact of this approach in the current pandemic context. The systematic review was performed on March 23, 2020, using PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Biblioteca Virtual de Saúde (BVS). The data were summarized in tables and critically analyzed. After the database search, 12 relevant studies were identified as eligible for the review. Among the drugs reported in these studies, 57 showed some evidence of antiviral activity. Antivirals, especially antiretrovirals, are the main class of therapeutic agents evaluated against COVID-19. Moreover, studies have reported the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of antitumor (16%; 9/57), antimalarial (7%, 4/57), and antibacterial (5%; 3/57) agents. Additionally, seven pharmacological agents (chloroquine, tetrandrine, umifenovir (arbidol), carrimycin, damageprevir, lopinavir/ritonavir) are in phase IV of clinical trials. Due to the evidence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of various clinically available agents, drug repositioning stands out as a promising strategy for a short-term response in the fight against the novel coronavirus.	32514689	Archives of virology	1432-8798	10.1007/s00705-020-04693-5
MSC Therapies for COVID-19: Importance of Patient Coagulopathy, Thromboprophylaxis, Cell Product Quality and Mode of Delivery for Treatment Safety and Efficacy.	https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01091	19/06/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.3389/fimmu.2020.01091	1664-3224	16643224	FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY (ONLINE)	A1	2.331	155	8.54	-	['Terapia celular']	['Cell Therapy']	Numerous clinical trials of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) as a new treatment for coronavirus-induced disease (COVID-19) have been registered recently, most of them based on intravenous (IV) infusion. There is no approved effective therapy for COVID-19, but MSC therapies have shown first promise in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) pneumonia, inflammation, and sepsis, which are among the leading causes of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Many of the critically ill COVID-19 patients are in a hypercoagulable procoagulant state and at high risk for disseminated intravascular coagulation, thromboembolism, and thrombotic multi-organ failure, another cause of high fatality. It is not yet clear whether IV infusion is a safe and effective route of MSC delivery in COVID-19, since MSC-based products express variable levels of highly procoagulant tissue factor (TF/CD142), compromising the cells' hemocompatibility and safety profile. Of concern, IV infusions of poorly characterized MSC products with unchecked (high) TF/CD142 expression could trigger blood clotting in COVID-19 and other vulnerable patient populations and further promote the risk for thromboembolism. In contrast, well-characterized products with robust manufacturing procedures and optimized modes of clinical delivery hold great promise for ameliorating COVID-19 by exerting their beneficial immunomodulatory effects, inducing tissue repair and organ protection. While the need for MSC therapy in COVID-19 is apparent, integrating both innate and adaptive immune compatibility testing into the current guidelines for cell, tissue, and organ transplantation is critical for safe and effective therapies. It is paramount to only use well-characterized, safe MSCs even in the most urgent and experimental treatments. We here propose three steps to mitigate the risk for these vulnerable patients: (1) updated clinical guidelines for cell and tissue transplantation, (2) updated minimal criteria for characterization of cellular therapeutics, and (3) updated cell therapy routines reflecting specific patient needs.	32574263	Frontiers in immunology	1664-3224	10.3389/fimmu.2020.01091

Though previous coronaviruses have caused substantial epidemics in recent years, effective therapies remained limited at the start of the Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. The emergence and rapid spread throughout the globe of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus necessitated a rapid development of therapeutics. Given the multitude of therapies that have emerged over the last two years and the evolution of data surrounding the efficacy of these therapies, we aim to provide an update on the major clinical trials that influenced clinical utilization of various COVID-19 therapeutics. This review focuses on currently used therapies in the United States and discusses the molecular mechanisms by which these therapies target the SARS-CoV-2 virus or the COVID-19 disease process. PubMed and EMBASE were used to find trials assessing the efficacy of various COVID-19 therapies. The keywords SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, and the names of the various therapies included in this review were searched in different combinations to find large-scale randomized controlled trials performed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple therapeutic options are currently approved for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and prevention of severe disease in high-risk individuals in both in the inpatient and outpatient settings. In severe disease, a combination of antiviral and immunomodulatory treatments is currently recommended for treatment. Additionally, anti-viral agents have shown promise in preventing severe disease and hospitalization for those in the outpatient setting. More recently, current therapeutic approaches are directed toward early treatment with monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Despite this, no treatment to date serves as a definitive cure and vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus remain our best defense to prevent further morbidity and mortality.	32516429	British journal of haematology	1365-2141	10.1111/bjh.16927

We aimed to investigate the association between chronic use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and COVID-19-related outcomes in hypertensive patients.                                                  METHODS                   A single-center study was conducted on 133 consecutive hypertensive subjects presenting to the emergency department with acute respiratory symptoms and/or fever who were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between 9 and 31 March 2020.                                                  RESULTS                   All patients were grouped according to their chronic antihypertensive medications (ACEIs, N = 40; ARBs, N = 42; not on RAAS inhibitors, N = 51). There was no statistical difference between ACEIs and ARBs groups in terms of hospital admission rate, oxygen therapy, and need for noninvasive ventilation. Patients chronically treated with RAAS inhibitors showed a significantly lower rate of admission to semi-intensive/intensive care units, when compared with the non-RAAS population (odds ratio (OR) 0.25, confidence interval (CI) 95% 0.09–0.66, P = 0.006). Similarly, the risk of mortality was lower in the former group, although not reaching statistical significance (OR 0.56, CI 95% 0.17–1.83, P = 0.341).                                                  CONCLUSIONS                   Our data suggest that chronic use of RAAS inhibitors does not negatively affect clinical course of COVID-19 in hypertensive patients. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding and determine whether RAAS inhibitors may have a protective effect on COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality.

However, there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. This study enrolled 33 COVID-19 patients in the nineth hospital of Nanchang from 27th January to 24th February 2020. Clinical indexes of patients upon admission/discharge were examined. Patients were divided into two groups according to different treatment plans (danoprevir and lopinavir/ritonavir). The days to achieve negative nucleic acid testing and the days of hospital stays were counted and statistically analyzed. COVID-19 patients treated with danoprevir or lopinavir/ritonavir were all improved and discharged. Indexes like blood routine, inflammation and immune-related indexes were significantly recovered after treatment. Additionally, under the circumstance that there was no significant difference in patients' general information between the two groups, we found that the mean time to achieve both negative nucleic acid testing and hospital stays of patients treated with danoprevir were significantly shorter than those of patients with lopinavir/ritonavir. Collectively, applying danoprevir is a good treatment plan for COVID-19 patients.	32501538	Journal of medical virology	1096-9071	10.1002/jmv.26141

The globally pandemic outbreak suggests that COVID-19 is highly infectious and difficult to control. A dual-combination of ribavirin and interferon-α has been the widely used regimen for the treatment of this disease in China. However, due to the varying results of treatment with these drugs, a novel antiviral combination therapy is urgently needed.

Tocilizumab is interleukin-6 inhibitors that has been shown to hamper the catastrophic outcomes of CCS including the need for mechanical ventilation as well as reduce mortality, but the usage is limited by warnings of reactivation of potential latent infections or immune dysfunctions including severe neutropenia. We describe a case of 39-year-old Nepalese male patient with a background of scleritis maintained on azathioprine and rituximab therapy with normal baseline parameters including complete blood count who presented with acute COVID-19 infection including associated leukopenia as well as severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count of 300 cells/µl), then progressed to critical disease culminating into CSS. Based on risks and benefits evaluation, the patient was treated with tocilizumab reinforced with granulocytes-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF, Filgrastim) to full recovery and safe outcome including reversal of neutropenia.	35664523	Clinical case reports	2050-0904	10.1002/ccr3.5932

We report our case series of 6 KTs with COVID-19 pneumonia who received TCZ: All were of male gender, with a mean age of 55.5 ± 8.4 years, a median time from transplantation of 3611 days (1465-5757); 5/6 had cardiovascular comorbidities, 1/6 had diabetes, and 3/6 have one or more previous KTs. Four out of six patients died, at an average time of 9.75 ± 2.4 days after tocilizumab administration, 3/6 due to a coexistent septic shock. Two patients improved after TCZ and were discharged at 20 and 21 days, respectively; in both patient, a significant increase of total lymphocyte count was observed. In conclusion, KTs, where the role of peculiar factors such as chronic immunosuppression is still undetermined, represent a high-risk group with significant COVID-19-associated mortality. The evaluation of the TCZ effect in COVID-19 pneumonia requires controlled studies (ideally RCTs) in this specific population.	32500936	Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society	1399-3062	10.1111/tid.13348

All adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study in two designated hospitals during 21 January 2020 to 16 March 2020 in Anhui, China. In all patients, data on the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding were analyzed by reviewing all RNA detection results during hospitalization. In addition, demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory, and outcome data were also collected from electronic medical records. Factors associated with prolonged viral shedding were analyzed with the Cox proportional hazards model. Among 181 patients, the mean age was 44.3 ± 13.2 years, and 55.2% were male. The median duration of viral shedding from illness onset was 18.0 days (interquartile range [IQR], 15.0-24.0). Prolonged viral shedding was associated with longer hospital stays (P < .001) and higher medical costs (P < .001). The severity of COVID-19 had nothing to do with prolonged shedding. Moreover, the median time from onset to antiviral treatment initiation was 5.0 days (IQR, 3.0-7.0). Delayed antiviral treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.976; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.962-0.990]) and lopinavir/ritonavir + interferon-α (IFN-α) combination therapy as the initial antiviral treatment (HR 1.649; 95% CI, 1.162-2.339) were independent factors associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.

Adverse outcomes with COVID-19 have been linked to cytokine storm but the most effective way to address exaggerated inflammatory response is complex and unclear. The Expert Working Group on the Commission of Human Medicines in the UK and other organizations have stated that there is insufficient evidence to establish a link between ibuprofen and susceptibility to or exacerbation of COVID-19. NSAID use must also be categorized by whether the drugs are relatively low-dose over-the-counter oral products taken occasionally versus higher-dose or parenteral NSAIDs. Even if evidence emerged arguing for or against NSAIDs in this setting, it is unclear if this evidence would apply to all NSAIDs at all doses in all dosing regimens. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) has been proposed as an alternative to NSAIDs but there are issues with liver toxicity at high doses. There are clearly COVID-19 cases where NSAIDs should not be used, but there is no strong evidence that NSAIDs must be avoided in all patients with COVID-19; clinicians must weigh these choices on an individual basis.	32447629	Pain and therapy	2193-8237	10.1007/s40122-020-00173-5

The lack of high-quality research has translated to an absence of clarity at the bedside. With disease spread outpacing treatment consensus, provider discretion has taken on a heightened role. Here, we report a case of dexmedetomidine use in the setting of worsening hypoxemia, whereby oxygenation improved and intubation was avoided. Well known pharmacologic properties of the drug, namely the lack of respiratory depression and its anti-delirium effects, as well as other possible physiologic effects, suggest potential benefit for patients being managed with a delayed intubation approach. If dexmedetomidine can improve compliance with non-invasive oxygen support (the current recommended first-line therapy) while promoting better oxygenation, it may also decrease the need for mechanical ventilation and thus improve mortality.	32475761	The American journal of emergency medicine	1532-8171	10.1016/j.ajem.2020.05.066

This meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of current option of therapies for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) besides COVID-19, in an attempt to identify promising therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and WANFANG DATA for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort, and retrospective cohort studies that evaluated therapies (hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapy, and ribavirin-based therapy, etc.) for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. The primary outcomes were mortality, virological eradication and clinical improvement, and secondary outcomes were improvement of symptoms and chest radiography results, incidence of acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS), utilization of mechanical ventilation, and adverse events (AEs). Summary relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models, and the quality of evidence was appraised using GRADEpro.

Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the management of COVID-19: Much kerfuffle but little evidence	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2020.05.010	23/05/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1016/j.therap.2020.05.010	0040-5957	00405957	Therapie	-	0.442	36	1.73	-	['Cloroquina', 'Hidroxicloroquina']	['Chloroquine', 'Hydroxychloroquine']	Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are drugs that have shown in vitro activity on the replication of certain coronaviruses. In the context of the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic, the virus responsible for the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), these two drugs have been proposed as possible treatments. The results of the first clinical studies evaluating the effect of hydroxychloroquine do not support any efficacy of this drug in patients with COVID-19, due to major methodological weaknesses. Yet, these preliminary studies have aroused considerable media interest, raising fears of massive and uncontrolled use. In the absence of evidence of clinical benefits, the main risk is of exposing patients unnecessarily to the well-known adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine, with a possibly increased risk in the specific setting of COVID-19. In addition, widespread use outside of any recommendation risks compromising the completion of good quality clinical trials. The chloroquine hype, fueled by low-quality studies and media announcements, has yielded to the implementation of more than 150 studies worldwide. This represents a waste of resources and a loss of opportunity for other drugs to be properly evaluated. In the context of emergency, rigorous trials are more than ever needed in order to have, as soon as possible, reliable data on drugs that are possibly effective against the disease. Meanwhile, serious adverse drug reactions have been reported in patients with COVID-19 receiving hydroxychloroquine, justifying to limit its prescription, and to perform suitable cardiac and therapeutic drug monitoring.	32473812	Therapie	1958-5578	10.1016/j.therap.2020.05.010

Both drugs may increase risk of lethal arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation. Methods and Results We analyzed a case series of COVID-19-positive/suspected patients admitted between February 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, or a combination of both drugs. We evaluated baseline and postmedication QT interval (corrected QT interval [QTc]; Bazett) using 12-lead ECGs. Critical QTc prolongation was defined as follows: (1) maximum QTc ≥500 ms (if QRS <120 ms) or QTc ≥550 ms (if QRS ≥120 ms) and (2) QTc increase of ≥60 ms. Tisdale score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated. Of 490 COVID-19-positive/suspected patients, 314 (64%) received either/both drugs and 98 (73 COVID-19 positive and 25 suspected) met study criteria (age, 62±17 years; 61% men). Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and both in 62%.

On the basis of clinical practice and in-vitro studies, we postulated that post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) using Arbidol is associated with decreased infection among individuals exposed to confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. We conducted a retrospective cohort study on family members and health care workers who were exposed to patients confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time RT-PCR and chest computed tomography (CT) from January 1 to January 16, 2020. The last follow-up date was Feb. 26, 2020. The emergence of fever and/or respiratory symptoms after exposure to the primary case was collected. The correlations between post-exposure prophylaxis and infection in household contacts and health care workers were respectively analyzed. A total of 66 members in 27 families and 124 health care workers had evidence of close exposure to patients with confirmed COVID-19. The Cox regression based on the data of the family members and health care workers with Arbidol or not showed that Arbidol PEP was a protective factor against the development of COVID-19 (HR 0.025, 95% CI 0.003-0.209, P=0.0006 for family members and HR 0.056, 95% CI 0.005-0.662, P=0.0221 for health care workers). Our findings suggest Arbidol could reduce the infection risk of the novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings. This treatment should be promoted for PEP use and should be the subject of further investigation.	32474860	Current medical science	2523-899X	10.1007/s11596-020-2203-3
Lack of viral clearance by the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin or lopinavir and ritonavir in SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome.	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-020-00678-4	24/05/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1186/s13613-020-00678-4	2110-5820	21105820	ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE	A1	2.219	60	7.23	-	['Azitromicina', 'Hidroxicloroquina', 'Lopinavir', 'Ritonavir']	['Azithromycin', 'Hydroxychloroquine', 'Lopinavir', 'Ritonavir']	The efficient transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from patients to health care workers or family members has been a worrisome and prominent feature of the ongoing outbreak. On the basis of clinical practice and in-vitro studies, we postulated that post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) using Arbidol is associated with decreased infection among individuals exposed to confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection.

Systematic assessment of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients receiving thromboprophylaxis: incidence and role of D-dimer as predictive factors.	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32451823	02/06/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32451823	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Profilaxia para tromboembolismo']	['Prophylaxis for thromboembolism']	Coagulopathy in COVID-19 is a burning issue and strategies to prevent thromboembolic events are debated and highly heterogeneous. The objective was to determine incidence and risk factors of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 inpatients receiving thromboprophylaxis. In this retrospective French cohort study, patients hospitalized in medical wards non-ICU with confirmed COVID-19 and adequate thromboprophylaxis were included. A systematic low limb venous duplex ultrasonography was performed at hospital discharge or earlier if deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was clinically suspected. Chest angio-CT scan was performed when pulmonary embolism (PE) was suspected. Of 71 patients, 16 developed VTE (22.5%) and 7 PE (10%) despite adequate thromboprophylaxis. D-dimers at baseline were significantly higher in patients with DVT (p < 0.001). Demographics, comorbidities, disease manifestations, severity score, and other biological parameters, including inflammatory markers, were similar in patients with and without VTE. The negative predictive value of a baseline D-dimer level < 1.0 µg/ml was 90% for VTE and 98% for PE. The positive predictive value for VTE was 44% and 67% for D-dimer level ≥ 1.0 µg/ml and ≥ 3 µg/ml, respectively. The association between D-dimer level and VTE risk increased by taking into account the latest available D-dimer level prior to venous duplex ultrasonography for the patients with monitoring of D-dimer. Despite thromboprophylaxis, the risk of VTE is high in COVID-19 non-ICU inpatients. Increased D-dimer concentrations of more than 1.0 μg/ml predict the risk of venous thromboembolism. D-dimer level-guided aggressive thromboprophylaxis regimens using higher doses of heparin should be evaluated in prospective studies.	32451823	Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis	1573-742X	10.1007/s11239-020-02146-z

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. Intravenous infusion of MSCs has shown promising results in COVID-19 treatment. Here, we report a case of a severe COVID-19 patient treated with human umbilical cord Wharton’s jelly-derived MSCs (hWJCs) from a healthy donor in Liaocheng People’s Hospital, China, from February 24, 2020. The pulmonary function and symptoms of the patient with COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly improved in 2 days after hWJC transplantation, and recovered and discharged in 7 days after treatment. After treatment, the percentage and counts of lymphocyte subsets (CD3 +, CD4 +, and CD8 + T cell) were increased, and the level of IL-6, TNF-α, and C-reactive protein is significantly decreased after hWJC treatment. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of hWJCs was safe and effective for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in a critically severe condition. This report highlights the potential of hWJC infusions as an effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia.

The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of pre-admission antithrombotic therapies in patients with COVID-19 and to investigate the potential association between antithrombotic therapy and ARDS, as disease clinical presentation, or in-hospital mortality. We enrolled 192 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to emergency department of five Italian hospitals. The study population was divided in two groups according to the evidence of ARDS at chest computed tomography at admission. Propensity score weighting adjusted regression analysis was performed to assess the risk ARDS at admission, and death during hospitalization, in patients treated or not with antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents. ARDS was reported in 73 cases (38 %), who showed more likely hypertension compared to those without ARDS (57.8 % vs 49.6 %; P = 0.005). Thirty-five patients (18.5 %) died during the hospitalization. Not survived COVID-19 patients showed a statistically significant increased age (77 ± 8.31 vs 65.57 ± 8.31; P = 0.001), hypertension (77.1 % vs 53.5 %; P = 0.018) and coronary artery disease prevalence (28.6 % vs 10.2 %; P = 0.009). Both unadjusted and adjusted regression analyses showed no difference in the risk of ARDS at admission, or death during hospitalization, between patients treated or not with antiplatelets or anticoagulants. Pre-admission antithrombotic therapy, both antiplatelet and anticoagulant, does not seem to show a protective effect in severe forms of COVID-19 with ARDS at presentation and rapidly evolving toward death.	32474087	Pharmacological research	1096-1186	10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104965

Early outpatient treatment of symptomatic, high-risk Covid-19 patients that should be ramped-up immediately as key to the pandemic crisis	https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaa093	27/05/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1093/aje/kwaa093	0002-9262	00029262	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY	A1	1.831	267	3.68	 Abstract More than 1.6 million Americans have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and more than 10 times that number carry antibodies to it. High-risk patients with progressing symptomatic disease currently have only hospitalization treatment, with its high mortality, available to them. An outpatient treatment that prevents hospitalization is desperately needed. Two candidate medications have been widely discussed: remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) + azithromycin (AZ). Remdesivir has shown mild effectiveness in hospitalized inpatients, but no trials in outpatients have been registered. HCQ + AZ has been widely misrepresented in both clinical reports and public media, and results of outpatient trials are not expected until September. Early outpatient illness is very different from later florid disease requiring hospitalization, and the treatments differ. Evidence about use of HCQ alone, or of HCQ + AZ in inpatients, is irrelevant with regard to the efficacy of HCQ + AZ in early high-risk outpatient disease. Five studies, including 2 controlled clinical trials, have demonstrated significant major outpatient treatment efficacy. HCQ + AZ has been used as the standard of care in more than 300,000 older adults with multiple comorbid conditions; the estimated proportion of such patients diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmia attributable to the medications is 47 per 100,000 users, among whom estimated mortality is less than 20% (9/100,000 users), as compared with the 10,000 Americans now dying each week. These medications need to be made widely available and promoted immediately for physicians to prescribe.

A number of anti-viral drugs such as ribavirin, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, antibiotics such as azithromycin and doxycycline, and anti-parasite such as ivermectin have been recommended for COVID-19 treatment. In addition, sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence have been presented to use chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, Zn has the ability to enhance innate and adaptive immunity in the course of a viral infection. Besides, Zn supplement can favour COVID-19 treatment using those suggested and/or recommended drugs. Again, the effectiveness of Zn can be enhanced by using chloroquine as an ionophore while Zn inside the infected cell can stop SARS-CoV-2 replication. Given those benefits, this perspective paper describes how and why Zn could be given due consideration as a complement to the prescribed treatment of COVID-19.	32458149	Biological trace element research	1559-0720	10.1007/s12011-020-02194-9

Cancer patient are at increased risk of infection compared to general population. On the other hand, these patients are at major risk of drug interactions caused by renal and hepatic impairment background. Because of the long-term use of chemotherapy drugs, drug interactions are important in these patients especially with SARS-CoV2 treatments now. This paper is review of reported drug interactions of current treatments for COVID-19 and anticancer agents.	32460133	Critical reviews in oncology/hematology	1879-0461	10.1016/j.critrevonc.2020.102982

In the absence of clinical trial results, we analysed epidemiological data to support or discard such a hypothesis. We retrieved information on exposure to DPP-4is among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) hospitalized for COVID-19 at an outbreak hospital in Italy. As a reference, we retrieved information on exposure to DPP-4is among matched patients with T2D in the same region. Of 403 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 85 had T2D. The rate of exposure to DPP-4is was similar between T2D patients with COVID-19 (10.6%) and 14 857 matched patients in the region (8.8%), or 793 matched patients in the local outpatient clinic (15.4%), 8284 matched patients hospitalized for other reasons (8.5%), and when comparing 71 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia (11.3%) with 351 matched patients with pneumonia of another aetiology (10.3%). T2D patients with COVID-19 who were on DPP-4is had a similar disease outcome as those who were not. In summary, we found no evidence that DPP-4is might affect hospitalization for COVID-19.	32463179	Diabetes, obesity & metabolism	1463-1326	10.1111/dom.14097

Negative impact of hyperglycaemia on tocilizumab therapy in Covid-19 patients	https://doi.org/doi:10.1016/j.diabet.2020.05.005	21/05/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	doi:10.1016/j.diabet.2020.05.005	1262-3636	12623636	DIABETES & METABOLISM	A2	1.834	94	4.51	-	['Tocilizumabe']	['Tocilizumab']	Tocilizumab (TCZ) is used for treating moderate-to-severe Covid-19 pneumonia by targeting interleukin-6 receptors (IL-6Rs) and reducing cytokine release. Yet, in spite of this therapy, patients with vs. patients without diabetes have an adverse disease course. In fact, glucose homoeostasis has influenced the outcomes of diabetes patients with infectious diseases. Of the 475 Covid-19-positive patients admitted to infectious disease departments (University of Bologna, University Vanvitelli of Napoli, San Sebastiano Caserta Hospital) in Italy since 1 March 2020, 31 (39.7%) hyperglycaemic and 47 (60.3%) normoglycaemic patients (blood glucose levels ≥140mg/dL) were retrospectively evaluated at admission and during their hospital stay. Of note, 20 (64%) hyperglycaemic and 11 (23.4%) normoglycaemic patients had diabetes (P<0.01). At admission, hyperglycaemic vs. normoglycaemic patients had fivefold higher IL-6 levels, which persisted even after TCZ administration (P<0.05). Intriguingly, in a risk-adjusted Cox regression analysis, TCZ in hyperglycaemic patients failed to attenuate risk of severe outcomes as it did in normoglycaemic patients (P<0.009). Also, in hyperglycaemic patients, higher IL-6 plasma levels reduced the effects of TCZ, while adding IL-6 levels to the Cox regression model led to loss of significance (P<0.07) of its effects. Moreover, there was evidence that optimal Covid-19 infection management with TCZ is not achieved during hyperglycaemia in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. These data may be of interest to currently ongoing clinical trials of TCZ effects in Covid-19 patients and of optimal control of glycaemia in this patient subset.	32447102	Diabetes & metabolism	1878-1780	10.1016/j.diabet.2020.05.005

This is a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection pneumonia from 3 hospitals in Hubei and Guangdong province, 141 adults (aged ≥18 years) without ventilation were included. Combined group patients were given Arbidol and IFN-α2b, monotherapy group patients inhaled IFN-α2b for 10-14 days. Of 141 COVID-19 patients, baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar between combined group and monotherapy group, that 30% of the patients leucocytes counts were below the normal range and 36.4% of the patients experienced lymphocytopenia. The duration of viral RNA of respiratory tract in the monotherapy group was not longer than that in the combined therapy group. There was no significant differences between two groups. The absorption of pneumonia in the combined group was faster than that in the monotherapy group. We inferred that Arbidol/IFN - 2 b therapy can be used as an effective method to improve the COVID-19 pneumonia of mild patients, although it helpless with accelerating the virus clearance. These results should be verified in a larger prospective randomized environment.	32445881	Microbes and infection	1769-714X	10.1016/j.micinf.2020.05.012

Remdesivir (formerly GS-5734) is a nucleoside analogue pro-drug currently being evaluated in COVID-19 clinical trials. Its unique structural features allow high concentrations of the active triphosphate metabolite to be delivered intracellularly and it evades proofreading to successfully inhibit viral RNA synthesis. In pre-clinical models, remdesivir has demonstrated potent antiviral activity against diverse human and zoonotic β-coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. In this article, we critically review available data on remdesivir with an emphasis on biochemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and in vitro activity against coronaviruses as well as clinical experience and current progress in COVID-19 clinical trials.	32446287	Pharmacotherapy	1875-9114	10.1002/phar.2429

Association of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors with COVID-19-related outcomes in Korea: a nationwide population-based cohort study	https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa624	22/05/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1093/cid/ciaa624	1058-4838	10584838	CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES	A1	4.394	353	8.72	 Abstract                                   Background                   Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors may facilitate host cell entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or attenuate organ injury via RAAS blockade. We aimed to assess the associations between prior use of RAAS inhibitors and clinical outcomes among Korean patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).                                                  Methods                   We performed a nationwide population-based cohort study using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment database. Claim records were screened for 69 793 individuals who were tested for COVID-19 until 8 April 2020. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used to compare the clinical outcomes between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers.                                                  Results                   Among 5179 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 762 patients were RAAS inhibitor users and 4417 patients were nonusers. Relative to nonusers, RAAS inhibitor users were more likely to be older, male, and have comorbidities. Among 1954 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 377 patients were RAAS inhibitor users, and 1577 patients were nonusers. In-hospital mortality was observed for 33 RAAS inhibitor users (9%) and 51 nonusers (3%) (P &amp;lt; .001). However, after adjustment for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, immunosuppression, and hospital type, the use of RAAS inhibitors was not associated with a higher risk of mortality (adjusted OR, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.53–1.44; P = .60). No significant differences were observed between RAAS inhibitor users and nonusers in terms of vasopressor use, modes of ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal replacement therapy, and acute cardiac events.

In addition to respiratory involvement, COVID-19 was also associated with significant multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Cardiovascular impairment has been observed and is now drawing growing attention. Cardiovascular protective strategies are urgent and of great significance to the overall prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Direct viral infection, cytokine storm, and aggravation of existing cardiovascular diseases were recognized as possible mechanisms of cardiovascular impairment in COVID-19. Hyperactivated inflammation plays an important role in all three mechanisms and is considered to be fundamental in the development of cardiovascular impairment and MODS in COVID-19. Therefore, in addition to conventional cardiovascular treatment, anti-inflammatory therapy is a reasonable strategy for severe cases to further enhance cardiovascular protection and potentially mitigate MODS. We reviewed the inflammatory features and current promising treatments of COVID-19 as well as cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapies that have been verified in previous clinical trials with positive outcomes. We believe that targeting the central pathway (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6), balancing the Th1 and Th2 response, and administering long-term anti-inflammatory therapy might be promising prospects to reduce cardiovascular impairment and even MODS during the acute and recovery phases of COVID-19. The cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapies might be of great application value to the management of COVID-19 patients and we further propose an algorithm for the selection of anti-inflammatory therapy for COVID-19 patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular impairment. We recommend to take the experiences in cardiovascular anti-inflammatory therapy as references in the management of COVID-19 and conduct related clinical trials, while the clinical translation of novel treatments from preclinical studies or 	32426374	Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine	2297-055X	10.3389/fcvm.2020.00078

The outbreak is managed by a combination of disease containment via public health measures and supportive care for those who are affected. To date, there is no specific anti-COVID-19 treatment. However, the urgency to identify treatments that could turn the tide has led to the emergence of several investigational drugs as potential candidates to improve outcome, especially in the severe to critically ill. While many of these adjunctive drugs are being investigated in clinical trials, professional bodies have attempted to clarify the setting where the use of these drugs may be considered as off-label or compassionate use.

Rationale for Prolonged Corticosteroid Treatment in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Caused by Coronavirus Disease 2019	https://journals.lww.com/ccejournal/Fulltext/2020/04000/Rationale_for_Prolonged_Corticosteroid_Treatment.18.aspx	24/05/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://journals.lww.com/ccejournal/Fulltext/2020/04000/Rationale_for_Prolonged_Corticosteroid_Treatment.18.aspx	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Corticosteroides', 'Corticosteroides', 'Corticosteroides', 'Corticosteroides']	['Corticosteroids', 'Corticosteroids', 'Corticosteroids', 'Corticosteroids']	One hundred and ten years after Noon's first clinical report of the subcutaneous application of allergen extracts, allergen immunotherapy (AIT) has evolved as the most important pillar of the treatment of allergic patients. It is the only disease-modifying treatment option available and the evidence for its clinical efficacy and safety is broad and undisputed. Throughout recent decades, more insights into the underlying mechanisms, in particular the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses, have been described. AIT is acknowledged by worldwide regulatory authorities, and following the regulatory guidelines for product development, AIT products are subject to a rigorous evaluation before obtaining market authorization. Knowledge and practice are anchored in international guidelines, such as the recently published series of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI). Innovative approaches continue to be further developed with the focus on clinical improvement by, for example, the usage of adjuvants, peptides, recombinants, modification of allergens, new routes of administration, and the concomitant use of biologicals. In addition, real-life data provide complementary and valuable information on the effectiveness and tolerability of this treatment option in the clinical routine. New mobile health technologies and big-data approaches will improve daily treatment convenience, adherence, and efficacy of AIT. However, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has also had some implications for the feasibility and practicability of AIT. Taken together, AIT as the only disease-modifying therapy in allergic diseases has been broadly investigated over the past 110 years laying the path for innovations and further improvement.	32426753	Critical care explorations	2639-8028	10.1097/CCE.0000000000000111

Factors associated with prolonged viral shedding and impact of Lopinavir/Ritonavir treatment in hospitalised non-critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection	https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00799-2020	08/05/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1183/13993003.00799-2020	0903-1936	09031936	THE EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL	A1	4.336	255	9.39	  Background The duration of viral shedding is central to the guidance of decisions about isolation precautions and antiviral treatment. However, studies regarding the risk factors associated with prolonged shedding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the impact of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) treatment on viral shedding remain scarce.  Methods Data were collected from all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted to isolation wards and had reverse transcription PCR conversion at the No. 3 People's Hospital of Hubei province, China, between 31 January and 9 March 2020. We compared clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding between patients initiated with LPV/r treatment and those without. Logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate the risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding.  Results Of 120 patients, the median age was 52 years, 54 (45%) were male and 78 (65%) received LPV/r treatment. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset was 23 days (interquartile range 18–32 days). Older age (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00–1.05; p=0.03) and the lack of LPV/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10–5.36; p=0.029) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Patients who initiated LPV/r treatment within 10 days from symptom onset, but not initiated from day 11 onwards, had significantly shorter viral shedding duration compared with those without LPV/r treatment (median 19 days  versus 28.5 days; log-rank p&lt;0.001).  Conclusion Older age and the lack of LPV/r treatment were independently associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Earlier administration of LPV/r treatment could shorten viral shedding duration.

SARS2-CoV-2 and Stroke in a New York Healthcare System	https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.030335	20/05/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.030335	0039-2499	00392499	STROKE (DALLAS. 1970)	A1	3.245	330	6.52	              Background and Purpose:             With the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the current worldwide pandemic, there is mounting evidence that patients affected by the illness may develop clinically significant coagulopathy with thromboembolic complications including ischemic stroke. However, there is limited data on the clinical characteristics, stroke mechanism, and outcomes of patients who have a stroke and COVID-19.                                  Methods:             We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with ischemic stroke who were hospitalized between March 15, 2020, and April 19, 2020, within a major health system in New York, the current global epicenter of the pandemic. We compared the clinical characteristics of stroke patients with a concurrent diagnosis of COVID-19 to stroke patients without COVID-19 (contemporary controls). In addition, we compared patients to a historical cohort of patients with ischemic stroke discharged from our hospital system between March 15, 2019, and April 15, 2019 (historical controls).                                  Results:                           During the study period in 2020, out of 3556 hospitalized patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, 32 patients (0.9%) had imaging proven ischemic stroke. Cryptogenic stroke was more common in patients with COVID-19 (65.6%) as compared to contemporary controls (30.4%,               P              =0.003) and historical controls (25.0%,               P              &lt;0.001). When compared with contemporary controls, COVID-19 positive patients had higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and higher peak D-dimer levels. When compared with historical controls, COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to be younger men with elevated troponin, higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with COVID-19 and stroke had significantly higher mortality than historical and contemporary controls.                                              Conclusions:             We observed a low rate of imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Most strokes were cryptogenic, possibly related to an acquired hypercoagulability, and mortality was increased. Studies are needed to determine the utility of therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke and other thrombotic event prevention in patients with COVID-19.

Its antiviral properties have been studied for years; regarding the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), it has been shown that HCQ may act at multiple levels. These extend from the initial attachment of the virus to the respiratory epithelium to the inhibition of its replication by the alkalinisation of the phagolysosome's microenvironment and the post-translational modification of certain viral proteins. Preliminary clinical evidence from China and France showed significant virological and clinical benefit in HCQ-treated patients, while other studies, mostly including critically ill patients, did not show favorable results. In this review, we critically appraise the existing evidence on HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 with particular emphasis on its protective and therapeutic role. Safety concerns that are relevant to the short-term HCQ use are also discussed. In the context of the rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic that strains the health care systems worldwide and considering limited population-wide testing rates in most of the vulnerable countries, early empiric short-term administration of HCQ in symptomatic individuals, may be a promising, safe and low-cost strategy.	32432527	European journal of rheumatology	2147-9720	10.5152/eurjrheum.2020.2064

Recently some in-vitro and in-vivo study showing possible inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by use of HCQ. However at the same time, some case studies showing NO clinical benefit/ poor clinical outcome with substantial detrimental adverse effects by use of HCQ in treatment of coronavirus disease-2019. Thus, the HCQ use (in COVID-19 treatment) is of current international interest, although a consensus has not yet been reached. More evidences are still required to prove efficacy of HCQ against COVID-19. In view of this, the present review highlights the current ongoing research related to use of HCQ in treatment coronavirus disease-2019. The present review will discuss the possible anti-viral mechanism of HCQ, prophylaxis strategy and effect of HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 virus in-vitro study. Further this review also summarizes and debates all available clinical trials/ case studies of HCQ use against COVID-19 (with clinical outcome). Finally possible detrimental adverse effects are also discussed considering the public health and pharmacovigilance concern.&#x0D;Keywords: Potency of hydroxychloroquine; COVID-19; Coronavirus disease-2019; Clinical trials; SARS-CoV-2; Adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine; Pharmacovigilance concern	['Hidroxicloroquina']	['Hydroxychloroquine']	-	-	-	-	-

Methods:             We studied a total of 143 patients with COVID-19 from January 29, 2020 to February 29, 2020. Demographic and clinical data, laboratory data, including ultrasound scans of the lower extremities, and outcome variables were obtained, and comparisons were made between groups with and without DVT.                                  Results:                           Of the 143 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (age 63±14 years, 74 [51.7%] men), 66 patients developed lower extremity DVT (46.1%: 23 [34.8%] with proximal DVT and 43 [65.2%] with distal DVT). Compared with patients who did not have DVT, patients with DVT were older and had a lower oxygenation index, a higher rate of cardiac injury, and worse prognosis, including an increased proportion of deaths (23 [34.8%] versus 9 [11.7%];               P              =0.001) and a decreased proportion of patients discharged (32 [48.5%] versus 60 [77.9%];               P              &lt;0.001). Multivariant analysis showed an association only between CURB-65 (confusion status, urea, respiratory rate, and blood pressure) score 3 to 5 (odds ratio, 6.122;               P              =0.031), Padua prediction score ≥4 (odds ratio, 4.016;               P              =0.04), D-dimer &gt;1.0 μg/mL (odds ratio, 5.818;               P              &lt;0.014), and DVT in this cohort, respectively. The combination of a CURB-65 score 3 to 5, a Padua prediction score ≥4, and D-dimer &gt;1.0 μg/mL has a sensitivity of 88.52% and a specificity of 61.43% for screening for DVT. In the subgroup of patients with a Padua prediction score ≥4 and whose ultrasound scans were performed &gt;72 hours after admission, DVT was present in 18 (34.0%) patients in the subgroup receiving venous thromboembolism prophylaxis versus 35 (66.0%) patients in the nonprophylaxis group (               P              =0.010).                                              Conclusions:             The prevalence of DVT is high and is associated with adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism may be protective in patients with a Padua protection score ≥4 after admission. Our data seem to suggest that COVID-19 is probably an additional risk factor for DVT in hospitalized patients.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children is typically minimally symptomatic. We report a series of febrile pediatric patients with acute heart failure potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.                                  Methods:             Over a 2-month period, contemporary with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France and Switzerland, we retrospectively collected clinical, biological, therapeutic, and early outcomes data in children who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in 14 centers for cardiogenic shock, left ventricular dysfunction, and severe inflammatory state.                                  Results:             Thirty-five children were identified and included in the study. Median age at admission was 10 years (range, 2–16 years). Comorbidities were present in 28%, including asthma and overweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms were prominent. Left ventricular ejection fraction was &lt;30% in one-third; 80% required inotropic support with 28% treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Inflammation markers were suggestive of cytokine storm (interleukin-6 median, 135 pg/mL) and macrophage activation (D-dimer median, 5284 ng/mL). Mean BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) was elevated (5743 pg/mL). Thirty-one of 35 patients (88%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swab or serology. All patients received intravenous immunoglobulin, with adjunctive steroid therapy used in one-third. Left ventricular function was restored in the 25 of 35 of those discharged from the intensive care unit. No patient died, and all patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were successfully weaned.                                  Conclusions:             Children may experience an acute cardiac decompensation caused by severe inflammatory state after SARS-CoV-2 infection (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children). Treatment with immunoglobulin appears to be associated with recovery of left ventricular systolic function.          	['Imunoglobulina']	['Immunoglobulin']	-	-	-	-	-

Here, we will provide an overview of therapeutic options for COVID-19. Plasma from patients recovered from COVID-19 that contains antibodies against SARS-CoV2 has shown promising results in patients with severe COVID-19. Also, IVIG, combined with moderate-dose of corticosteroids, might improve patient outcomes. Evidence links COVID-19 to variable degrees of inflammation. Studies show that the use of corticosteroids might accelerate recovery from COVID-19. There are, however, no controlled clinical trials that show whether the use of corticosteroids can reduce COVID-19-related death. Also, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL6 is the best-documented cytokine in COVID-19 correlated with severity, criticality, viral load, and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL6, could confer clinical benefit in patients with high IL6 levels. Essential elements that process SARS-CoV2 cell entry and specific characteristics that allow SARS-CoV2 to escape the immune system have the potential as targets for COVID-19 therapy.	32413736	International immunopharmacology	1878-1705	10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106560
SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: is interleukin-6 (IL-6) the 'culprit lesion' of ARDS onset? What is there besides Tocilizumab? SGP130Fc	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590153220300094	14/05/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590153220300094	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Inibidores de interleucina-6']	['Interleukin-6 inhibitors']	Since the outbreak of COVID-19 many studies have been published showing possible therapies, here the author discusses the end of stage disease related drugs, like Tocilizumab which is currently being used in ARDS patients. In some patients, disease progression leads to an enormous secretion of cytokines, known as cytokine storm, among those cytokines IL-6 plays an important role. Here the author shows how IL-6 has both pro and anti-inflammatory properties, depending on the pathway of transduction: soluble (trans-signaling) or membrane-related (classic signaling), and suggests how targeting only the pro-inflammatory pathway, with SGP130Fc, could be a better option then targeting them both. Other possible IL-6 pathway inhibitors such as Ruxolitinib and Baricinitib are then analyzed, underlying how they lack the benefit of targeting only the pro-inflammatory pathway.	32421092	Cytokine: X	2590-1532	10.1016/j.cytox.2020.100029

Nifedipine and Amlodipine are associated with improved mortality and decreased risk for intubation and mechanical ventilation in elderly patients hospitalized for COVID-19	http://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8069	12/05/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.7759/cureus.8069	2168-8184	21688184	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Anlodipina', 'Nifedipino']	['Amlodipine', 'Nifedipine']	Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) are typically used agents in the clinical management of hypertension. Yet, they have also been utilized in the treatment of various pulmonary disorders with vasoconstriction. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been implicated in the development of vasoconstrictive, proinflammatory, and pro-oxidative effects. A retrospective review was conducted on CCB use in hospitalized patients in search of any difference in outcomes related to specific endpoints: survival to discharge and progression of disease leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. The electronic medical records for all patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 that were at or above the age of 65 and that expired or survived to discharge from a community hospital in Brooklyn, NY, between the start of the public health crisis due to the viral disease up until April 13, 2020, were included. Of the 77 patients that were identified, 18 survived until discharge and 59 expired. Seven patients from the expired group were excluded since they died within one day of presentation to the hospital. Five patients were excluded from the expired group since their age was above that of the eldest patient in the survival group (89 years old). With 65 patients left, 24 were found to have been administered either amlodipine or nifedipine (CCB group) and 41 were not (No-CCB group). Patients treated with a CCB were significantly more likely to survive than those not treated with a CCB: 12 (50%) survived and 12 expired in the CCB group vs. six (14.6%) that survived and 35 (85.4%) that expired in the No-CCB treatment group (P<.01; p=0.0036). CCB patients were also significantly less likely to undergo intubation and mechanical ventilation. Only one patient (4.2%) was intubated in the CCB group whereas 16 (39.0%) were intubated in the No-CCB treatment group (P<.01; p=0.0026). Nifedipine and amlodipine were found to be associated with significantly improved mortality and a decreased risk for intubation and mechanical ventilation in elderly patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Further clinical studies are warranted. Including either nifedipine or amlodipine in medication regimens for elderly patients with hypertension hospitalized for COVID-19 may be considered.	32411566	Cureus	2168-8184	10.7759/cureus.8069

Remdesivir has shown in vitro activity against coronaviruses and is a possible antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This prospective (compassionate), open-label study of remdesivir, which was conducted at Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy, between February 23 and March 20, 2020, involved patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia aged ≥18 years undergoing mechanical ventilation or with an oxygen saturation level of ≤94 % in air or a National Early Warning Score 2 of ≥4. The primary outcome was the change in clinical status based on a 7-category ordinal scale (1 = not hospitalised, resuming normal daily activities; 7 = deceased). The 35 patients enrolled from February 23 to March 20, 2020, included 18 in intensive care unit (ICU), and 17 in our infectious diseases ward (IDW). The 10-day course of remdesivir was completed by 22 patients (63 %) and discontinued by 13, of whom eight (22.8 %) discontinued because of adverse events. The median follow-up was 39 days (IQR 25-44). At day 28, 14 (82.3 %) patients from IDW were discharged, two were still hospitalized and one died (5.9 %), whereas in ICU 6 (33.3 %) were discharged, 8 (44.4 %) patients died, three (16.7 %) were still mechanically ventilated and one (5.6 %) was improved but still hospitalized. Hypertransaminasemia and acute kidney injury were the most frequent severe adverse events observed (42.8 % and 22.8 % of the cases, respectively). Our data suggest that remdesivir can benefit patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia hospitalised outside ICU where clinical outcome was better and adverse events are less frequently observed. Ongoing randomised controlled trials will clarify its real efficacy and safety, who to treat, and when.	32407959	Pharmacological research	1096-1186	10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104899

This case series explores the safety and effectiveness of intravenous allogeneic cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), formulated as CAP-1002, in critically ill patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Adverse reactions to CAP-1002, clinical status on the World Health Organization (WHO) ordinal scale, and changes in pro-inflammatory biomarkers and leukocyte counts were analyzed. All patients ( n = 6; age range 19–75 years, 1 female) required ventilatory support (invasive mechanical ventilation,  n = 5) with PaO 2/FiO 2 ranging from 69 to 198. No adverse events related to CAP-1002 administration were observed. Four patients (67%) were weaned from respiratory support and discharged from the hospital. One patient remains mechanically ventilated as of April 28th, 2020; all survive. A contemporaneous control group of critically ill COVID-19 patients ( n = 34) at our institution showed 18% overall mortality at a similar stage of hospitalization. Ferritin was elevated in all patients at baseline (range of all patients 605.43–2991.52 ng/ml) and decreased in 5/6 patients (range of all patients 252.89–1029.90 ng/ml). Absolute lymphocyte counts were low in 5/6 patients at baseline (range 0.26–0.82 × 10 3/µl) but had increased in three of these five patients at last follow-up (range 0.23–1.02 × 10 3/µl). In this series of six critically ill COVID-19 patients, intravenous infusion of CAP-1002 was well tolerated and associated with resolution of critical illness in 4 patients. This series demonstrates the apparent safety of CAP-1002 in COVID-19. While this initial experience is promising, efficacy will need to be further assessed in a randomized controlled trial.

The spectrum of symptoms ranges from asymptomatic infections to mild respiratory symptoms to the lethal form of COVID-19 which is associated with severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, and fatality. To address this global crisis, up-to-date information on viral genomics and transcriptomics is crucial for understanding the origins and global dispersion of the virus, providing insights into viral pathogenicity, transmission, and epidemiology, and enabling strategies for therapeutic interventions, drug discovery, and vaccine development. Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 epidemiology, genomic etiology, findings from recent transcriptomic map analysis, viral-human protein interactions, molecular diagnostics, and the current status of vaccine and novel therapeutic intervention development. Moreover, we provide an extensive list of resources that will help the scientific community access numerous types of databases related to SARS-CoV-2 OMICs and approaches to therapeutics related to COVID-19 treatment.	32397688	Viruses	1999-4915	10.3390/v12050526

Potential use of hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin and azithromycin drugs in fighting COVID-19: trends, scope and relevance	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2052297520300366	22/04/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2052297520300366	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Azitromicina', 'Hidroxicloroquina', 'Ivermectina']	['Azithromycin', 'Hydroxychloroquine', 'Ivermectin']	Alarming situation has been caused due to the emergence of COVID-19 infection around the world. There is an urgency of developing a therapeutic strategy in order to control the spread of COVID-19. Towards that initiative, potential drugs like hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin and azithromycin have been tested by diverse group of researchers worldwide for their potential against novel coronavirus. The present report presents together the comprehensive knowledge derived from the major researches about the above drugs altogether in context of the current health emergency around the world. Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were known to act by creating the acidic environment and inhibiting the importin (IMPα/β1) mediated viral import. Azithromycin was found to act similar to the hydroxychloroquine as an acidotropic lipophilic weak base. All the three categories of drugs seemed to potentially act against novel coronavirus infection. However, their efficacies need to be studied in detail individually and in combination in-vivo in order to combat COVID-19 infection.	32322397	New microbes and new infections	2052-2975	10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100684

We hypothesized that patient outcomes would be improved at our tertiary cardiothoracic surgery referral center with a protocolized team-approach for ECMO treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 disease.  Case presentation A 51-year-old healthy female developed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) bilateral pneumonia while vacationing in Colorado with her family. She was transferred to our facility for a higher level of care. Her respiratory status continued to deteriorate despite maximized critical care, including prone positioning ventilation and nitric oxide inhalation therapy. Veno-venous ECMO was initiated on hospital day 7 in conjunction with a 10-day course of compassionate use antiviral treatment with remdesivir. The patient’s condition improved significantly and she was decannulated from ECMO on hospital day 17 (ECMO day 11). She was successfully extubated and eventually discharged to rehabilitation on hospital day 28.  Conclusion This case report demonstrates a positive outcome in a young patient with COVID-19 treated by the judicious application of ECMO in conjunction with compassionate use antiviral treatment (remdesivir). Future prospective multi-center studies are needed to validate these findings in a larger cohort of patients.

Pneumonia is the most common cause of death in the extremely old subject. During infection and its complication such as sepsis, hypotension could be exacerbated by antihypertensive drugs because homeostasis mechanisms such as sodium balance, renin angiotensin aldosterone system and/or sympathetic nervous system can be mitigated by antihypertensive drug therapy. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-1 and 2 viral surface protein is known to attach angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell membrane to facilitate viral entry into the cytoplasm. Despite the theoretical concerns of increased ACE2 expression by Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system (RAS) blockade, there is no evidence that RAS inhibitors are harmful during COVID-19 infection and have in fact been shown to be beneficial in animal studies. Therefore, it is recommended to maintain RAS blockade during the current corona virus pandemic.	32391169	Clinical hypertension	2056-5909	10.1186/s40885-020-00144-0

Initially, SARS-CoV-2 infects cells in the respiratory system and causes inflammation and cell death. Subsequently, the virus spreads out and damages other vital organs and tissues, triggering a complicated spectrum of pathophysiological changes and symptoms, including cardiovascular complications. Acting as the receptor for SARS-CoV entering mammalian cells, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiovascular cell function. Diverse clinical manifestations and laboratory abnormalities occur in patients with cardiovascular injury in COVID-19, characterizing the development of this complication, as well as providing clues to diagnosis and treatment.

Clinical Features and Outcomes of 98 Patients Hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Daegu, South Korea: A Brief Descriptive Study	https://www.eymj.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3349/ymj.2020.61.5.431	24/04/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://www.eymj.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3349/ymj.2020.61.5.431	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Hidroxicloroquina', 'Lopinavir', 'Ritonavir']	['Hydroxychloroquine', 'Lopinavir', 'Ritonavir']	Although some information on the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and a few selected cases has been reported, data on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized therewith in South Korea are lacking. We conducted a retrospective single-center study of 98 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at Yeungnam University Medical Center in Daegu, South Korea. Sixty patients were women (61.2%), and the mean age was 55.4±17.1 years. Thirteen patients (13.3%) were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). The mean interval from symptom onset to hospitalization was 7.7±4.5 days. Patients who received ICU care were significantly older and were more likely to have diabetes mellitus. The National Early Warning Score on the day of admission was significantly higher in patients requiring ICU care. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (13/13 patients; 100%), septic shock (9/13; 69.2%), acute cardiac injury (9/13; 69.2%), and acute kidney injury (8/13; 61.5%) were more common in patients who received ICU care. All patients received antibiotic therapy, and most (97/98 patients; 99.0%) received antiviral therapy (lopinavir/ritonavir). Hydroxychloroquine was used in 79 patients (80.6%), and glucocorticoid therapy was used in 18 patients (18.4%). In complete blood counts, lymphopenia was the most common finding (40/98 patients; 40.8%). Levels of all proinflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in ICU patients. As of March 29, 2020, the mortality rate was 5.1%. Here, we report the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of SARS-CoV-2 patients in South Korea up to March 29, 2020.	32390367	Yonsei medical journal	1976-2437	10.3349/ymj.2020.61.5.431

Potential Cytoprotective Activity of Ozone Therapy in SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32384798/	06/05/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	PUBMED_ID:32384798/	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Ozonioterapia']	['Ozone Therapy']	(1) Background: The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak. Systemic ozone therapy (OT) could be potentially useful in the clinical management of several complications secondary to SARS-CoV-2. The rationale and mechanism of action has already been proven clinically in other viral infections and has been shown in research studies to be highly effective at decreasing organ damage mediated by inflammation and oxidative stress. This review summarizes the OT studies that illustrate the possible cytoprotective mechanism of action of ozone and its physiological by-products in target organs affected by SARS-CoV-2. (2) Methods: This review encompasses a total of 74 peer-reviewed original articles. It is mainly focused on ozone as a modulator of the NF-κ B/Nrf2 pathways and IL-6/IL-1β expression. (3) Results: In experimental models and the few existent clinical studies, homeostasis of the free radical and antioxidant balance by OT was associated with a modulation of NF-κ B/Nrf2 balance and IL-6 and IL-1β expression. These molecular mechanisms support the cytoprotective effects of OT against tissue damage present in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. (4) Conclusions: The potential cytoprotective role of OT in the management of organ damage induced by COVID-19 merits further research. Controlled clinical trials are needed.	32384798	Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)	2076-3921	10.3390/antiox9050389

A prospective series of 100 consecutive patients admitted to the Spedali Civili University Hospital in Brescia (Italy) between March 9th and March 20th with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS requiring ventilatory support was analyzed to determine whether intravenous administration of tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor, was associated with improved outcome. Tocilizumab was administered at a dosage of 8 mg/kg by two consecutive intravenous infusions 12 h apart. A third infusion was optional based on clinical response. The outcome measure was an improvement in acute respiratory failure assessed by means of the Brescia COVID Respiratory Severity Score (BCRSS 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating higher severity) at 24-72 h and 10 days after tocilizumab administration. Out of 100 treated patients (88 M, 12 F; median age: 62 years), 43 received TCZ in the intensive care unit (ICU), while 57 in the general ward as no ICU beds were available. Of these 57 patients, 37 (65%) improved and suspended noninvasive ventilation (NIV) (median BCRSS: 1 [IQR 0-2]), 7 (12%) patients remained stable in NIV, and 13 (23%) patients worsened (10 died, 3 were admitted to ICU). Of the 43 patients treated in the ICU, 32 (74%) improved (17 of them were taken off the ventilator and were discharged to the ward), 1 (2%) remained stable (BCRSS: 5) and 10 (24%) died (all of them had BCRSS≥7 before TCZ). Overall at 10 days, the respiratory condition was improved or stabilized in 77 (77%) patients, of whom 61 showed a significant clearing of diffuse bilateral opacities on chest x-ray and 15 were discharged from the hospital. Respiratory condition worsened in 23 (23%) patients, of whom 20 (20%) died. All the patients presented with lymphopenia and high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, ferritin and IL-6 indicating a HIS. During the 10-day follow-up, three cases of severe adverse events were recorded: two patients developed septic shock and died, one had gastrointestinal perforation requiring urgent surgery and was alive at day 10. In conclusion, our series showed that COVID-19 pneumonia with ARDS was characterized by HIS. The response to TCZ was rapid, sustained, and associated with significant clinical improvement.	32376398	Autoimmunity reviews	1873-0183	10.1016/j.autrev.2020.102568

Cardiac safety of off-label COVID-19 drug therapy: a review and proposed monitoring protocol	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2048872620922784	06/05/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1177/2048872620922784	2048-8726	20488726	European Heart Journal: Acute Cardiovascular Care	-	1.467	40	4.82	 More than 2,000,000 individuals worldwide have had coronavirus 2019 disease infection (COVID-19), yet there is no effective medical therapy. Multiple off-label and investigational drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, have gained broad interest due to positive pre-clinical data and are currently used for treatment of COVID-19. However, some of these medications have potential cardiac adverse effects. This is important because up to one-third of patients with COVID-19 have cardiac injury, which can further increase the risk of cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. Adverse effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on cardiac function and conduction are broad and can be fatal. Both drugs have an anti-arrhythmic property and are proarrhythmic. The American Heart Association has listed chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as agents which can cause direct myocardial toxicity. Similarly, other investigational drugs such as favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir can prolong QT interval and cause Torsade de Pointes. Many antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, for instance azithromycin, can also prolong QT interval. This review summarizes evidenced-based data regarding potential cardiac adverse effects due to off-label and investigational drugs including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, antiviral therapy, monoclonal antibodies, as well as common antibiotics used for the treatment of COVID-19.

Multiple off-label and investigational drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, have gained broad interest due to positive pre-clinical data and are currently used for treatment of COVID-19. However, some of these medications have potential cardiac adverse effects. This is important because up to one-third of patients with COVID-19 have cardiac injury, which can further increase the risk of cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. Adverse effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on cardiac function and conduction are broad and can be fatal. Both drugs have an anti-arrhythmic property and are proarrhythmic. The American Heart Association has listed chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as agents which can cause direct myocardial toxicity. Similarly, other investigational drugs such as favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir can prolong QT interval and cause Torsade de Pointes. Many antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, for instance azithromycin, can also prolong QT interval. This review summarizes evidenced-based data regarding potential cardiac adverse effects due to off-label and investigational drugs including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, antiviral therapy, monoclonal antibodies, as well as common antibiotics used for the treatment of COVID-19. The article focuses on practical points and offers a point-of-care protocol for providers who are taking care of patients with COVID-19 in an inpatient and outpatient setting. The proposed protocol is taking into consideration that resources during the pandemic are limited.	32372695	European heart journal. Acute cardiovascular care	2048-8734	10.1177/2048872620922784

Being the first pandemic in the post-genomic era, advancements in genomics contributed significantly to scientific understanding and public health response to COVID-19. Genomic technologies have been employed by researchers all over the world to better understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and its origin, genomic diversity, and evolution. Worldwide genomic resources have greatly aided in the investigation of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has ushered in a new era of genomic surveillance, wherein scientists are tracking the changes of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in real-time at the international and national levels. Availability of genomic and proteomic information enables the rapid development of molecular diagnostics and therapeutics. The advent of high-throughput sequencing and genome editing technologies led to the development of modern vaccines. We briefly discuss the impact of genomics in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in this review.	32362051	Dermatologic therapy	1529-8019	10.1111/dth.13499

However, as lack of the specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug, systemic steroid treatment has not been recommended for COVID-19. We report here three cases of the COVID-19 pneumonia successfully treated with ciclesonide inhalation. Rationale of the treatment is to mitigate the local inflammation with inhaled steroid that stays in the lung and to inhibit proliferation of the virus by antiviral activity.

Mounting evidence suggests that COVID-19 is fueled by a maladaptive host inflammatory response that involves excessive activation of innate immune pathways. While a "cytokine storm" involving IL-6 and other cytokines has been documented, complement C3 activation has been implicated as an initial effector mechanism that exacerbates lung injury in preclinical models of SARS-CoV infection. C3-targeted intervention may provide broader therapeutic control of complement-mediated inflammatory damage in COVID-19 patients. Herein, we report the clinical course of a patient with severe ARDS due to COVID-19 pneumonia who was safely and successfully treated with the compstatin-based complement C3 inhibitor AMY-101.	32360516	Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)	1521-7035	10.1016/j.clim.2020.108450

Evidence for Use or Disuse of Renin–Angiotensin System Modulators in Patients Having COVID-19 With an Underlying Cardiorenal Disorder	https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1074248420921720	30/04/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1177/1074248420921720	1074-2484	10742484	JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS	A2	0.685	52	2.63	  Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has been declared pandemic by World Health Organization due to an exponential rise in the number of infected and deceased persons across the globe. Emerging reports suggest that susceptibility and mortality rates are higher in patients with certain comorbidities when compared to the average population. Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are important risk factors for a lethal outcome of COVID-19. Extensive research ensuing the outbreak of coronavirus-related severe acute respiratory syndrome in the year 2003, and COVID-19 recently revealed a role of renin–angiotensin system (RAS) components in the entry of coronavirus wherein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) had garnered the significant attention. This raises the question whether the use of RAS inhibitors, the backbone of treatment of cardiovascular, neurovascular, and kidney diseases could increase the susceptibility for coronavirus infection or unfortunate outcomes of COVID-19. Thus, currently, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effects of RAS inhibitors in such patients. Moreover, expert bodies like American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and so on have now released official statements that RAS inhibitors must be continued, unless suggested otherwise by a physician. In this brief review, we will elaborate on the role of RAS and ACE2 in pathogenesis of COVID-19. Moreover, we will discuss the potential effect of the use and disuse of RAS inhibitors in patients having COVID-19 with cardiometabolic comorbidities.

Rethinking the role of hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19	https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fj.202000919	29/04/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1096/fj.202000919	0892-6638	08926638	THE FASEB JOURNAL	A1	1.385	287	5.11	-	['Cloroquina', 'Hidroxicloroquina']	['Chloroquine', 'Hydroxychloroquine']	There are currently no proven or approved treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Early anecdotal reports and limited in vitro data led to the significant uptake of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and to lesser extent chloroquine (CQ), for many patients with this disease. As an increasing number of patients with COVID-19 are treated with these agents and more evidence accumulates, there continues to be no high-quality clinical data showing a clear benefit of these agents for this disease. Moreover, these agents have the potential to cause harm, including a broad range of adverse events including serious cardiac side effects when combined with other agents. In addition, the known and potent immunomodulatory effects of these agents which support their use in the treatment of auto-immune conditions, and provided a component in the original rationale for their use in patients with COVID-19, may, in fact, undermine their utility in the context of the treatment of this respiratory viral infection. Specifically, the impact of HCQ on cytokine production and suppression of antigen presentation may have immunologic consequences that hamper innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses for patients with COVID-19. Similarly, the reported in vitro inhibition of viral proliferation is largely derived from the blockade of viral fusion that initiates infection rather than the direct inhibition of viral replication as seen with nucleoside/tide analogs in other viral infections. Given these facts and the growing uncertainty about these agents for the treatment of COVID-19, it is clear that at the very least thoughtful planning and data collection from randomized clinical trials are needed to understand what if any role these agents may have in this disease. In this article, we review the datasets that support or detract from the use of these agents for the treatment of COVID-19 and render a data informed opinion that they should only be used with caution and in the context of carefully thought out clinical trials, or on a case-by-case basis after rigorous consideration of the risks and benefits of this therapeutic approach.	32350928	FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology	1530-6860	10.1096/fj.202000919

The virus, which belongs to the coronavirus family (SARS-CoV-2), was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Full-length genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 showed 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV, with 96% identity to a bat coronavirus at the whole-genome level. COVID-19 has caused over 133,000 deaths and there are over 2 million total confirmed cases as of April 15th, 2020. Current treatment plans are still under investigation due to a lack of understanding of COVID-19. One potential mechanism to slow disease progression is the use of antiviral drugs to either block the entry of the virus or interfere with viral replication and maturation. Currently, antiviral drugs, including chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir, have shown effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Due to the high dose needed and narrow therapeutic window, many patients are experiencing severe side effects with the above drugs. Hence, repurposing these drugs with a proper formulation is needed to improve the safety and efficacy for COVID-19 treatment. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a family of natural carriers in the human body. They play a critical role in cell-to-cell communications. EVs can be used as unique drug carriers to deliver protease inhibitors to treat COVID-19. EVs may provide targeted delivery of protease inhibitors, with fewer systemic side effects. More importantly, EVs are eligible for major aseptic processing and can be upscaled for mass production. Currently, the FDA is facilitating applications to treat COVID-19, which provides a very good chance to use EVs to contribute in this combat.	32357553	Viruses	1999-4915	10.3390/v12050486

Chloroquine-induced QTc prolongation in COVID-19 patients	https://doi.org/10.1007/s12471-020-01429-7	29/04/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1007/s12471-020-01429-7	1568-5888	15685888	Netherlands Heart Journal	-	0.753	38	1.55	 Abstract  Background In the battle against the SARS-CoV‑2 pandemic, chloroquine has emerged as a new potential therapeutic option for the treatment of infected patients. A safety consideration for the application of chloroquine is its QTc-prolonging potential. Thus far, no data are available on the QTc-prolonging potential of chloroquine in COVID-19 patients.  Objective To assess the degree of chloroquine-induced QTc prolongation in hospitalised COVID-19 patients.  Methods A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and ECGs recorded during chloroquine treatment were retrospectively collected in patients suspected of having COVID-19. The QTc interval was calculated by computerised and manual interpretation. Baseline and follow-up QTc intervals were compared using the paired samples  t-test.  Results A total of 95 patients had a baseline ECG recording and at least one ECG recording during chloroquine therapy. Chloroquine treatment resulted in a mean QTc prolongation of 35 ms (95% CI 28–43 ms) using computerised interpretation and 34 ms (95% CI 25–43 ms) using manual interpretation. No torsade de pointes was observed during chloroquine treatment. After manual review, 22 patients (23%) had a QTc interval exceeding 500 ms during chloroquine treatment. None of these patients had a prolonged QTc interval prior to the initiation of chloroquine treatment.  Conclusions Chloroquine significantly prolongs the QTc interval in a clinically relevant matter. This highlights the need for ECG monitoring when prescribing chloroquine to COVID-19 patients.

Effects Of ARBs And ACEIs On Virus Infection, Inflammatory Status And Clinical Outcomes In COVID-19 Patients With Hypertension: A Single Center Retrospective Study	https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15143	01/05/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15143	0194-911X	0194911X	HYPERTENSION (DALLAS, TEX. 1979)	A1	3.395	276	7.36	             With the capability of inducing elevated expression of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or ACE inhibitors treatment may have a controversial role in both facilitating virus infection and reducing pathogenic inflammation. We aimed to evaluate the effects of ARBs/ACE inhibitors on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a retrospective, single-center study. One hundred twenty-six patients with COVID-19 and preexisting hypertension at Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Wuhan from January 5 to February 22, 2020, were retrospectively allocated to ARBs/ACE inhibitors group (n=43) and non-ARBs/ACE inhibitors group (n=83) according to their antihypertensive medication. One hundred twenty-five age- and sex-matched patients with COVID-19 without hypertension were randomly selected as nonhypertension controls. In addition, the medication history of 1942 patients with hypertension that were admitted to Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from November 1 to December 31, 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak were also reviewed for external comparison. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected, analyzed, and compared between these groups. The frequency of ARBs/ACE inhibitors usage in patients with hypertension with or without COVID-19 were comparable. Among patients with COVID-19 and hypertension, those received either ARBs/ACE inhibitors or non-ARBs/ACE inhibitors had comparable blood pressure. However, ARBs/ACE inhibitors group had significantly lower concentrations of hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein;             P            =0.049) and PCT (procalcitonin,             P            =0.008). Furthermore, a lower proportion of critical patients (9.3% versus 22.9%;             P            =0.061) and a lower death rate (4.7% versus 13.3%;             P            =0.216) were observed in ARBs/ACE inhibitors group than non-ARBs/ACE inhibitors group, although these differences failed to reach statistical significance. Our findings thus support the use of ARBs/ACE inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 and preexisting hypertension.

Effect of Convalescent Plasma Therapy on Viral Shedding and Survival in COVID-19 Patients	https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa228	29/04/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1093/infdis/jiaa228	0022-1899	00221899	THE JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES	A1	2.509	261	5.29	 Abstract                Currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been reported in almost all countries globally. No effective therapy has been documented for COVID-19, and the role of convalescent plasma therapy is unknown. In the current study, 6 patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure received convalescent plasma a median of 21.5 days after viral shedding was first detected, all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA within 3 days after infusion, and 5 eventually died. In conclusion, convalescent plasma treatment can end SARS-CoV-2 shedding but cannot reduce the mortality rate in critically ill patients with end-stage COVID-19, and treatment should be initiated earlier.

Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been shown to be a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host target cells. Given that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) upregulated ACE2 expression in animal studies, the concern might arise regarding whether ARBs and ACEIs would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. On the other hand, animal data suggested a potential protective effect of ARBs against COVID-19 pneumonia because an ARB prevented the aggravation of acute lung injury in mice infected with SARS-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, however, there is no clinical or experimental evidence supporting that ARBs and ACEIs either augment the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 or aggravate the severity and outcomes of COVID-19 at present. Until further data are available, it is recommended that ARB and ACEI medications be continued for the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease and hypertension, especially those at high risk, according to guideline-directed medical therapy based on the currently available evidence.	32341442	Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension	1348-4214	10.1038/s41440-020-0455-8

Global economies are also spiraling towards a recession in fear of this new life-threatening disease. Vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapeutics that reduces the risk of severe Covid-19 are thus urgently needed. A rapid method to derive antiviral treatment for Covid-19 is the use of convalescent plasma derived hyperimmune globulin. However, both hyperimmune globulin and vaccine development face a common hurdle - the risk of antibody-mediated disease enhancement. The goal of this review is to examine the body of evidence supporting the hypothesis of immune enhancement that could be pertinent to Covid-19. We also discuss how this risk could be mitigated so that both hyperimmune globulin and vaccines could be rapidly translated to overcome the current global health crisis.	32344202	EBioMedicine	2352-3964	10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102768

Subsequently, coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) provoked a pandemic which is considered a life-threatening disease. The SARS-CoV-2, a family member of betacoronaviruses, possesses single-stranded positive-sense RNA with typical structural proteins, involving the envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid and spike proteins that are responsible for the viral infectivity, and nonstructural proteins. The effectual host immune response including innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-Cov-2 seems crucial to control and resolve the viral infection. However, the severity and outcome of the COVID-19 might be associated with the excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines “cytokine storm” leading to an acute respiratory distress syndrome. Regretfully, the exact pathophysiology and treatment, especially for the severe COVID-19, is still uncertain. The results of preliminary studies have shown that immune-modulatory or immune-suppressive treatments such as hydroxychloroquine, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 antagonists, commonly used in rheumatology, might be considered as treatment choices for COVID-19, particularly in severe disease. In this review, to gain better information about appropriate anti-inflammatory treatments, mostly used in rheumatology for COVID-19, we have focused the attention on the structural features of SARS-CoV-2, the host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and its association with the cytokine storm.	32299202	Turkish journal of medical sciences	1303-6165	10.3906/sag-2004-168

A novel coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. This virus represents a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with more than 1,948,617 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 121,846 deaths worldwide. Currently, no specific medication is recommended to treat COVID-19 patients. However, governments and pharmaceutical companies are struggling to quickly find an effective drug to defeat the coronavirus. In the current review, we summarize the existing state of knowledge about COVID-19, available medications, and treatment options. Favilavir is an antiviral drug that is approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now approved to treat symptoms of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs used to treat malaria and arthritis, respectively, were recommended by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19. Presently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are under investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for COVID-19. The first COVID-19 vaccine is not expected to be ready for clinical trials before the end of the year.	32320825	Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases	1567-7257	10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104327

We are facing a new virus, so several antiviral agents previously used to treat other coronavirus infections such as SARS and MERS are being considered as the first potential candidates to treat COVID-19. Thus, several agents have been used by the beginning of the current outbreak in China first and all over the word successively, as reported in several different guidelines and therapeutic recommendations. At the same time, a great number of clinical trials have been launched to investigate the potential efficacy therapies for COVID-19 highlighting the urgent need to get as quickly as possible high-quality evidence. Through PubMed, we explored the relevant articles published on treatment of COVID-19 and on trials ongoing up to April 15, 2020.	32335561	Le infezioni in medicina	2532-8689	10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105984

There is currently no specific treatment available for patients with COVID-19 infection. The lessons learned from past management of respiratory viral infections have provided insights into treating COVID-19. Numerous potential therapies, including supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and convalescent plasma transfusion, have been tentatively applied in clinical settings. A number of these therapies have provided substantially curative benefits in treating patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, intensive research and clinical trials are underway to assess the efficacy of existing drugs and identify potential therapeutic targets to develop new drugs for treating COVID-19. Herein, we summarize the current potential therapeutic approaches for diseases related to COVID-19 infection and introduce their mechanisms of action, safety, and effectiveness.	32334062	Brain, behavior, and immunity	1090-2139	10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.046

The zoonotic SARS-CoV-2, believed to have originated from infected bats, is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus. Specifically, the overall genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to that of bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13. Although the current mortality rate of 2% is significantly lower than that of SARS (9.6%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (35%), SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and transmissible from human to human with an incubation period of up to 24 days. Some statistical studies have shown that, on average, one infected patient may lead to a subsequent 5.7 confirmed cases. Since the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, China, there has been a total of 60,412 confirmed cases with 1370 fatalities reported in 25 different countries as of February 13, 2020. The outbreak has led to severe impacts on social health and the economy at various levels. This paper is a review of the significant, continuous global effort that was made to respond to the outbreak in the first 75 days. Although no vaccines have been discovered yet, a series of containment measures have been implemented by various governments, especially in China, in the effort to prevent further outbreak, whilst various medical treatment approaches have been used to successfully treat infected patients. On the basis of current studies, it would appear that the combined antiviral treatment has shown the highest success rate. This review aims to critically summarize the most recent advances in understanding the coronavirus, as well as the strategies in prevention and treatment.	32235575	International journal of environmental research and public health	1660-4601	10.3390/ijerph17072323
A hypothesis for pathobiology and treatment of COVID-19: the centrality of ACE1/ACE2 imbalance	https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bph.15082	24/04/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1111/bph.15082	0007-1188	00071188	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY	A1	1.993	223	8.41	-	['Antagonistas do Receptor da Angiotensina II', 'Inibidores da Enzima Conversora da Angiotensina 2 (IECA 2)']	['Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists', 'Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACEI 2) Inhibitors']	Angiotensin Converting Enzyme2 is the cell surface binding site for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. We propose that an imbalance in the action of ACE1- and ACE2-derived peptides, thereby enhancing angiotensin II (Ang II) signalling is primary driver of COVID-19 pathobiology. ACE1/ACE2 imbalance occurs due to the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, reducing ACE2-mediated conversion of Ang II to Ang peptides that counteract pathophysiological effects of ACE1-generated ANG II. This hypothesis suggests several approaches to treat COVID-19 by restoring ACE1/ACE2 balance: (a) AT receptor antagonists; (b) ACE1 inhibitors (ACEIs); (iii) agonists of receptors activated by ACE2-derived peptides (e.g. Ang (1-7), which activates MAS1); (d) recombinant human ACE2 or ACE2 peptides as decoys for the virus. Reducing ACE1/ACE2 imbalance is predicted to blunt COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality, especially in vulnerable patients. Importantly, approved AT antagonists and ACEIs can be rapidly repurposed to test their efficacy in treating COVID-19.

Effective therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to reduce the spread of the virus and its death toll. Here, we assess the possibility of using interferon-lambda (IFNλ), a third type of interferon sharing low homology with type I IFNs and IL-10, for treating COVID-19 patients. We discuss the unique role of IFNλ in fine-tuning antiviral immunity in the respiratory tract to achieve optimal protection and minimal host damage and review early evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may impair IFNλ induction, leading to a delayed type I IFN-dominated response that triggers hyperinflammation and severe disease. We also consider the potential windows of opportunity for therapeutic intervention with IFNλ and potential safety considerations. We conclude that IFNλ constitutes a promising therapeutic agent for reducing viral presence and hyperinflammation in a single shot to prevent the devastating consequences of COVID-19 such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).	32333818	EMBO molecular medicine	1757-4684	10.15252/emmm.202012465

No specific therapies/vaccines are yet available for the treatment of COVID-19. Drug repositioning may offer a strategy and a number of drugs have been repurposed, including lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir and tocilizumab. This paper describes the main pharmacological properties of such drugs administered to patients with COVID-19, focusing on their antiviral, immune-modulatory and/or anti-inflammatory actions. Where available, data from clinical trials involving patients with COVID-19 are reported. Preliminary clinical trials seem to support their benefit. However, such drugs in COVID-19 patients have peculiar safety profiles. Thus, adequate clinical trials are necessary for these compounds. Nevertheless, while waiting for effective preventive measures i.e. vaccines, many clinical trials on drugs belonging to different therapeutic classes are currently underway. Their results will help us in defining the best way to treat COVID-19 and reducing its symptoms and complications.

The prompt outbreak of COVID-19 and its quick spread without any controllable measure defines the severity of the situation. In this crisis, a collective pool of knowledge about the advancement of clinical diagnostic and management for COVID-19 is a prerequisite. Here, we summarize all the available updates on the multidisciplinary approaches for the advancement of diagnosis and proposed therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Moreover, the review discusses different aspects of the COVID-19, including its epidemiology; incubation period; the general clinical features of patients; the clinical features of intensive care unit (ICU) patients; SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of co-morbid diseases and the clinical features of pediatric patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2. Advances in various diagnostic approaches, such as the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), chest radiography, and computed tomography (CT) imaging; and other modern diagnostic methods, for this infection have been highlighted. However, due to the unavailability of adequate evidence, presently there are no officially approved drugs or vaccines available against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we have discussed various therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 under different categories, like the possible treatment plans with drug (antiviral drugs and anti-cytokines) therapy for disease prevention.

Risks of ACE inhibitor and ARB usage in COVID-19: evaluating the evidence	https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cpt.1863	22/04/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1002/cpt.1863	0009-9236	00099236	CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS	A1	1.689	195	5.36	-	['Antagonistas do Receptor da Angiotensina II', 'Inibidores da Enzima Conversora da Angiotensina 2 (IECA 2)']	['Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists', 'Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACEI 2) Inhibitors']	Concerns have been raised regarding the safety of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), based on the hypothesis that such medications may raise expression of ACE2, the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We conducted a literature review of studies (n = 12) in experimental animals and human subjects (n = 12) and evaluated the evidence regarding the impact of administration of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 expression. We prioritized studies that assessed ACE2 protein expression data, measured directly or inferred from ACE2 activity assays. The findings in animals are inconsistent with respect to an increase in ACE2 expression in response to treatment with ACEIs or ARBs. Control/sham animals show little to no effect in the plurality of studies. Those studies that report increases in ACE2 expression tend to involve acute injury models and/or higher doses of ACEIs or ARBs than are typically administered to patients. Data from human studies overwhelmingly imply that administration of ACEIs/ARBs does not increase ACE2 expression. Available evidence, in particular, data from human studies, does not support the hypothesis that ACEI/ARB use increases ACE2 expression and the risk of complications from COVID-19. We conclude that patients being treated with ACEIs and ARBs should continue their use for approved indications.	32320478	Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics	1532-6535	10.1002/cpt.1863

The unabated spread of the disease is due to lack of vaccine and effective therapeutic agents against this novel virus. Hence, the situation demands an immediate need to explore all the plausible therapeutic and prophylactic strategies that can be made available to stem the spread of the disease. Towards this effort, the current review outlines the key aspects of the pathobiology associated with the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients, which includes a viral response phase and an exaggerated host response phase. The review also summarizes therapeutic agents that are currently being explored along with those with potential for consideration. The broad groups of therapeutic agents discussed include those that: (i) block viral entry to host cells, (ii) block viral replication and survival in host cells, and (iii) dampen exaggerated host immune response. The various kinds of pharmaceutical prophylactic options that may be followed to prevent COVID-19 have also been discussed.	32317431	Indian journal of ophthalmology	1998-3689	10.4103/ijo.IJO_639_20

Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which causes pneumonia, requires intensive care unit hospitalization in about 10% of cases and can lead to a fatal outcome. Several efforts are currently made to find a treatment for COVID-19 patients. So far, several anti-viral and immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs have demonstrated some efficacy on COVID-19 both in vitro and in animal models as well as in cases series. In COVID-19 patients a pro-inflammatory status with high levels of interleukin (IL)-1B, IL-1 receptor (R)A and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α has been demonstrated. Moreover, high levels of IL-6 and TNF-α have been observed in patients requiring intensive-care-unit hospitalization. This provided rationale for the use of anti-rheumatic drugs as potential treatments for this severe viral infection. Other agents, such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine might have a direct anti-viral effect. The anti-viral aspect of immunosuppressants towards a variety of viruses has been known since long time and it is herein discussed in the view of searching for a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection.	32317220	Journal of autoimmunity	1095-9157	10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102468

A retrospective analysis was performed on 217 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the First Hospital of Changsha in China, from January 17, 2020, to February 29, 2020. The active monitoring model in CHPS was used to detect ADR signals of the hospital information system. The risk factors for the ADRs were classified using the World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) system. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were carried out to analyze the risk factors of ADRs. Our results showed that the prevalence of ADRs was 37.8% in the patients, which was predominated by drug-induced gastrointestinal disorders and liver system disorders (23.0% vs. 13.8%). The ADR could be explained by the use of lopinavir/ ritonavir and umifenovir by 63.8% and 18.1%, respectively. There were 96.8% of ADRs that occurred within 14 days of hospitalization. Multivariable analysis showed that length of stay (odds ratio (OR): 2.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-3.96; P = 0.04), number of drugs used in the hospital (OR: 3.17; 95% CI 1.60-6.27; P = 0.001) and underlying basic diseases (OR: 2.07; 95% CI 1.02-4.23; P = 0.04) were independent risk factor for ADRs in the patients. Together, the incidence of ADRs was significantly high during the treatment period. Moreover, the active monitoring of the CHPS system reflected ADRs during COVID-19 treatment in the real world, which provided reference for safe medication in the clinic.	32324898	Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics	1532-6535	10.1002/cpt.1866

Although there are ongoing clinical trials of repurposed and investigational antiviral and immune-based therapies, there are as yet no scientifically proven, clinically effective pharmacological treatments for COVID-19. Among the repurposed drugs, the commonly used antimalarials chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have become the focus of global scientific, media, and political attention despite a lack of randomized clinical trials supporting their efficacy. Chloroquine has been used worldwide for about 75 years and is listed by the WHO as an essential medicine to treat malaria. Hydroxychloroquine is mainly used as a therapy for autoimmune diseases. However, the efficacy and safety of CQ/HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 remains to be defined. Indiscriminate promotion and widespread use of CQ/HCQ have led to extensive shortages, self-treatment, and fatal overdoses. Shortages and increased market prices leave all countries vulnerable to substandard and falsified medical products, and safety issues are especially concerning for Africa because of its healthcare system limitations. Much needed in Africa is a cross-continental collaborative network for coordinated production, distribution, and post-marketing surveillance aligned to low-cost distribution of any approved COVID-19 drug; this would ideally be piggybacked on existing global aid efforts. Meanwhile, African countries should strongly consider implementing prescription monitoring schemes to ensure that any off-label CQ/HCQ use is appropriate and beneficial during this pandemic.	32323646	The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene	1476-1645	10.4269/ajtmh.20-0290

Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases. In this study, aiming to investigate these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database, we conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model: exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited. There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation. Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.	32321905	Bioscience trends	1881-7823	10.5582/bst.2020.03082

Nearly 20% of COVID-19 patients present severe coagulation abnormalities, which may occur in almost all of the severe and critical ill COVID-19 cases. Concomitant venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potential cause of unexplained deaths, has been frequently reported in COVID-19 cases, but its management is still challenging due to the complexity between antithrombotic therapy and coagulation disorders. Based on frontline practical experience and comprehensive literature review, here a panel of experts and physicians from China and Europe developed an evidence and opinion-based consensus on the prophylaxis and management of VTE associated with COVID-19. This statement aims for clinicians treating COVID-19 and provides practical recommendations in detailed situations, for example, how to choose thromboprophylactic measures for patients with diverse severity of disease and bleeding risk, or which kind of anticoagulant should be prescribed. With limited experience on COVID19-associated VTE, this expert consensus statement should be helpful for clinicians worldwide with specific suggestions.

Many therapeutic agents that are being used to treat patients with COVID-19 are repurposed treatments for influenza, Ebola, or for malaria that were developed decades ago and are unlikely to be familiar to the cardiovascular and cardio-oncology communities. Here, we provide a foundation for cardiovascular and cardio-oncology physicians on the front line providing care to patients with COVID-19, so that they may better understand the emerging cardiovascular epidemiology and the biological rationale for the clinical trials that are ongoing for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.	32319102	Vox sanguinis	1423-0410	10.1111/vox.12939

Among people infected with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the intensive management of the critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU) needs substantial medical resource. In the present article, we have summarized the promising drugs, adjunctive agents, respiratory supportive strategies, as well as circulation management, multiple organ function monitoring and appropriate nutritional strategies for the treatment of COVID-19 in the ICU based on the previous experience of treating other viral infections and influenza. These treatments are referable before the vaccine and specific drugs are available for COVID-19.

PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH	A2	1.046	140	7.29	-	['Produtos naturais', 'Produtos naturais', 'Produtos naturais']	['Natural products', 'Natural products', 'Natural products']	Several corona viral infections have created serious threats in the last couple of decades claiming the death of thousands of human beings. Recently, corona viral epidemic raised the issue of developing effective antiviral agents at the earliest to prevent further losses. Natural products have always played a crucial role in drug development process against various diseases, which resulted in screening of such agents to combat emergent mutants of corona virus. This review focuses on those natural compounds that showed promising results against corona viruses. Although inhibition of viral replication is often considered as a general mechanism for antiviral activity of most of the natural products, studies have shown that some natural products can interact with key viral proteins that are associated with virulence. In this context, some of the natural products have antiviral activity in the nanomolar concentration (e.g., lycorine, homoharringtonine, silvestrol, ouabain, tylophorine, and 7-methoxycryptopleurine) and could be leads for further drug development on their own or as a template for drug design. In addition, a good number of natural products with anti-corona virus activity are the major constituents of some common dietary supplements, which can be exploited to improve the immunity of the general population in certain epidemics.	32248575	Phytotherapy research : PTR	1099-1573	10.1002/ptr.6700
Treatment efficacy analysis of traditional Chinese medicine for novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19): an empirical study from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China	https://cmjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13020-020-00317-x	15/04/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://cmjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13020-020-00317-x	1749-8546	17498546	Chinese Medicine	-	0.833	45	5.88	 Abstract  Background A novel coronavirus was identified in December, 2019 in Wuhan, China, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) played an active role in combating the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) caused by this fast-spreading virus COVID-19. Thus, we aimed to explore TCM characteristics of clinical efficacy to NCP, as well as to optimize Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPDD) and the recommended formulas to NCP by National Health Commission (NHC).  Methods Chinese medical sciences theory and clinical application of TCM were analyzed. A total of 54 NCP patients were observed in a hospital from Wuhan, whose clinical characteristics and utilization of Chinese Medicines (CMs) were described. Paired t test was used to measure the change of patients’ hemogram during hospitalization period, indicating the effect of CMs. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to explore the factors affecting the length of hospital stay. Network pharmacology analysis was applied to figure out the performance of NHC-recommended formulas of five disease stages at levels of compounds, targets and pathways.  Result The average length of hospital stay was 8.96 days. Patients over 45 stayed 9.79 days in hospital in average, longer than 7.64 days of patients under 45. Comparing the hemograms between admission and discharge of hospital, the number of leukocytes, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet increased, while the numbers of erythrocytes, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit decreased. According to the standard coefficients of regression, the factor affecting the length of stay for the most was CMs in category of invigorating spleen and removing dampness (ISRD), followed by administrating CMs, male, and cough. Thirty-two CMs were screened after deleting duplication from QFPDD and NHC-recommended formulas. Compound quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, acacetin etc., were all involved in the treatment of various disease stages on the compound level both in generality and individuality.  Conclusion TCM has a systemic theoretical understanding on the pathological evolution and a positive clinical efficacy on NCP. The CMs of ISRD improved patients’ recovery, suggesting the importance of regulating intestinal function and keeping microenvironmental balance in TCM treatment of NCP. The active compounds from QFPDD and NHC-recommended formulas contribute to recovery of varied disease progresses during TCM treating NCP.

Ebola, Influenza A (H1N1), SARS, MERS, and Zika virus have had a massive global impact in terms of economic disruption, the strain on local and global public health. Most recently, the global outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is a newly discovered virus from the coronavirus family in Wuhan city, China, known to be a great threat to the public health systems. As of 15 April 2020, The Johns Hopkins University estimated that the COVID-19 affected more than two million people, resulting in a death toll above 130,000 around the world. Infected people in Europe and America correspond about 40% and 30% of the total reported cases respectively. At this moment only few Asian countries have controlled the disease, but a second wave of new infections is expected. Predicting inhibitor and target to the COVID-19 is an urgent need to protect human from the disease. Therefore, a protocol to identify anti-COVID-19 candidate based on computer-aided drug design is urgently needed. Thousands of compounds including approved drugs and drugs in the clinical trial are available in the literature. In practice, experimental techniques can measure the time and space average properties but they cannot be captured the structural variation of the COVID-19 during the interaction of inhibitor. Computer simulation is particularly suitable to complement experiments to elucidate conformational changes at the molecular level which are related to inhibition process of the COVID-19.

It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric, and genitourinary bacterial infections. AZ is not approved for the treatment of viral infections, and there is no well-controlled, prospective, randomized clinical evidence to support AZ therapy in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, there are anecdotal reports that some hospitals have begun to include AZ in combination with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine (CQ) for treatment of COVID-19. It is essential that the clinical pharmacology (CP) characteristics of AZ be considered in planning and conducting clinical trials of AZ alone or in combination with other agents, to ensure safe study conduct and to increase the probability of achieving definitive answers regarding efficacy of AZ in the treatment of COVID-19.

Both COVID-19 and SARS-CoV belong to the coronavirus family and both invade target cells through ACE2. An in-depth understanding of ACE2 and a series of physiological and physiological changes caused by the virus invading the human body may help to discover and explain the corresponding clinical phenomena and then deal with them timely. In addition, ACE2 is a potential therapeutic target. This article will summarize the role of ACE2 in multiple organ damage caused by COVID-19 and SARS-CoV, targeted blocking drugs against ACE2, and drugs that inhibit inflammation in order to provide the basis for subsequent related research, diagnosis and treatment, and drug development.	32285293	European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology	1435-4373	10.1007/s10096-020-03883-y
Coronavirus Disease 2019 Treatment: A Review of Early and Emerging Options	https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa105	04/04/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1093/ofid/ofaa105	2328-8957	23288957	OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES	A3	1.317	45	3.66	 Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread across the globe resulting in a pandemic. At the time of this review, COVID-19 has been diagnosed in more than 200 000 patients and associated with over 8000 deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization). On behalf of the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists, we herein summarize the current evidence as of March 18, 2020 to provide guidance on potential COVID-19 treatment options. It is important to caution readers that new data emerges daily regarding clinical characteristics, treatment options, and outcomes for COVID-19. Optimized supportive care remains the mainstay of therapy, and the clinical efficacy for the subsequent agents is still under investigation. Antimicrobial stewardship programs, including infectious diseases pharmacists and physicians, are at the forefront of COVID-19 emergency preparedness. We encourage all readers to continue to assess clinical data as it emerges and share their experience within our community in a well-controlled, adequately powered fashion.

Anakinra is the first recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist studied for off-label use in COVID-19 treatment. This study reviews the current clinical evidence on the role of interleukin-1 in COVID-19-related cytokine storm, therapeutic effects, significant clinical concerns, and pros and cons of anakinra administration in the management of COVID-19 patients. In this review, four items are shown to be important for achieving the optimal therapeutic effects of anakinra in COVID-19 patients. These items include duration of treatment ≥ 10 days, doses ≥ 100 mg, intravenous administration, and early initiation of therapy. Also, anakinra might be more beneficial in the early stages of the disease when higher levels of cytokines are yet to be observed, which could prevent progression to severe illness and mechanical ventilation. Further studies are required to address the SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine release syndrome and the role of anakinra in identifying ideal treatment approaches for COVID-19 patients based on their clinical status.	32279655	Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation	2146-8427	10.6002/ect.2020.0109

Arbidol Monotherapy is Superior to Lopinavir/ritonavir in Treating COVID-19	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320301882	10/04/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320301882	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Lopinavir', 'Ritonavir', 'Umifenovir']	['Lopinavir', 'Ritonavir', 'Umifenovir']	Lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol have been previously used to treat acute respiratory syndrome- coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication in clinical practice; nevertheless, their effectiveness remains controversial. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral effects and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol in patients with the 2019-nCoV disease (COVID-19). Fifty patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were divided into two groups: including lopinavir/ritonavir group (34 cases) and arbidol group (16 cases). Lopinavir/ritonavir group received 400 mg/100mg of Lopinavir/ritonavir, twice a day for a week, while the arbidol group was given 0.2 g arbidol, three times a day. Data from these patients were retrospectively analyzed. The cycle threshold values of open reading frame 1ab and nucleocapsid genes by RT-PCR assay were monitored during antiviral therapy. None of the patients developed severe pneumonia or ARDS. There was no difference in fever duration between the two groups (P=0.61). On day 14 after the admission, no viral load was detected in arbidol group, but the viral load was found in 15(44.1%) patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. Patients in the arbidol group had a shorter duration of positive RNA test compared to those in the lopinavir/ritonavir group (P<0.01). Moreover, no apparent side effects were found in both groups. In conclusion, our data indicate that arbidol monotherapy may be superior to lopinavir/ritonavir in treating COVID-19.	32283143	The Journal of infection	1532-2742	10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.060

The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase. When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response. Further, the current treatment options, drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed. We suggest traditional Indian medicinal plants as possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways.	32278175	The Science of the total environment	1879-1026	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138277

However, at present, we are completely unaware of the response to SARS-CoV and SARS-COV-2 occurring in senescent cells. We deem that this is a priority area of research because it could lead to the development of several therapeutic strategies based on senotherapeutics or prevent unsuccessful attempts. Two of these senotherapeutics, azithromycin and ruxolitinib, are currently undergoing testing for their efficacy in treating COVID-19. The potential of these strategies is not only for ameliorating the consequences of the current emergence of SARS-CoV-2, but also for the future emergence of new viruses or mutated ones for which we are completely unprepared and for which no vaccines are available.	32276453	Cells	2073-4409	10.3390/cells9040909

While a specific treatment is not yet coming soon, individual risk assessment and management strategies are crucial. The individual preventive and protective measures drive the personal risk of getting the disease. Among the virus-contracted hosts, their different metabolic status, as determined by their diet, nutrition, age, sex, medical conditions, lifestyle, and environmental factors, govern the personal fate toward different clinical severity of COVID-19, from asymptomatic, mild, moderate, to death. The careful individual assessment for the possible dietary, nutritional, medical, lifestyle, and environmental risks, together with the proper relevant risk management strategies, is the sensible way to deal with the pandemic of SARS-CoV-II.	32276137	Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)	1521-7035	10.1016/j.clim.2020.108409
Inositol and pulmonary function. Could myo-inositol treatment downregulate inflammation and cytokine release syndrome in SARS-CoV-2?	https://www.europeanreview.org/article/20715	31/03/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	https://www.europeanreview.org/article/20715	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Mio-inositol', 'Tocilizumabe']	['Myo-inositol', 'Tocilizumab']	The outbreak of Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) poses serious challenges to people's health worldwide. The management of the disease is mostly supportive, and respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome is the leading cause of death in a significant proportion of affected patients. Preliminary data point out that dramatic increase in IL-6 and subsequent cytokine release syndrome may account for the development of fatal interstitial pneumonia. Inhibition of IL-6 by blocking its specific receptor with monoclonal antibodies has been advocated as a promising attempt. Here we assess the potential utility of myo-Inositol, a polyol already in use for treating the newborn Respiratory Distress Syndrome, in downregulating the inflammatory response upon Sars-CoV-2 infection. Myo-Inositol proved to reduce IL-6 levels in a number of conditions and to mitigate the inflammatory cascade, while being devoid of any significant side effects. It is tempting to speculate that inositol could be beneficial in managing the most dreadful effects of Sars-CoV-2 infection.	32271462	European review for medical and pharmacological sciences	2284-0729	10.26355/eurrev_202003_20715

Previously, we showed plasminogen itself is a key regulator in fibrin degradation, wound healing and infection.                                                  Aim                   We aimed to investigate whether plasminogen can improve lung lesions and hypoxemia of COVID-19.                                                  Design                   Thirteen clinically moderate, severe or critical COVID-19 patients were treated with atomization inhalation of freeze-dried plasminogen.                                                  Methods                   Levels of their lung lesions, oxygen saturation and heart rates were compared before and after treatment by computed tomography scanning images and patient monitor.                                                  Results                   After plasminogen inhalation, conditions of lung lesions in five clinically moderate patients have quickly improved, shown as the decreased range and density of ‘ground glass’ opacity. Improvements of oxygen saturation were observed in six clinically severe patients. In the two patients with critical conditions, the oxygen levels have significantly increased from 79–82% to 91% just about 1 h after the first inhalation. In 8 of 13 patients, the heart rates had slowed down. For the five clinically moderate patients, the difference is even statistically significant. Furthermore, a general relief of chest tightness was observed.                                                  Conclusion                   Whereas it is reported that plasminogen is dramatically increased in adults with ARDS, this study suggests that additional plasminogen may be effective and efficient in treating lung lesions and hypoxemia during COVID-19 infections. Although further studies are needed, this study highlights a possible hope of efficiently combating this rapid epidemic emergency.

In particular, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has quickly intensified interest in developing treatment options to mitigate impact on human life. Remdesivir (GS-5734™) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is now being tested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in international, multi-site clinical trials. Currently available evidence about the antiviral effects of remdesivir against coronaviruses is primarily based on 	32258351	One health (Amsterdam, Netherlands)	2352-7714	10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100128
COVID-19 and treatment with NSAIDs and corticosteroids: should we be limiting their use in the clinical setting?	https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.1023	30/03/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.3332/ecancer.2020.1023	1754-6605	17546605	ECANCER MEDICAL JOURNAL	B1	0.665	37	2.9	-	['Anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais', 'Corticosteroides']	['Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs', 'Corticosteroids']	Given the current SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, the availability of reliable information for clinicians and patients is paramount. There have been a number of reports stating that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids may exacerbate symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, this review aimed to collate information available in published articles to identify any evidence behind these claims with the aim of advising clinicians on how best to treat patients. This review found no published evidence for or against the use of NSAIDs in COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, there appeared to be some evidence that corticosteroids may be beneficial if utilised in the early acute phase of infection, however, conflicting evidence from the World Health Organisation surrounding corticosteroid use in certain viral infections means this evidence is not conclusive. Given the current availability of literature, caution should be exercised until further evidence emerges surrounding the use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients.	32256706	Ecancermedicalscience	1754-6605	10.3332/ecancer.2020.1023

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can manifest on a spectrum of illness from mild disease to severe respiratory failure requiring intensive care unit admission. As the incidence continues to rise at a rapid pace, critical care teams are faced with challenging treatment decisions. There is currently no widely accepted standard of care in the pharmacologic management of patients with COVID-19. Urgent identification of potential treatment strategies is a priority. Therapies include novel agents available in clinical trials or through compassionate use, and other drugs, repurposed antiviral and immunomodulating therapies. Many have demonstrated in vitro or in vivo potential against other viruses that are similar to SARS-CoV-2. Critically ill patients with COVID-19 have additional considerations related to adjustments for organ impairment and renal replacement therapies, complex lists of concurrent medications, limitations with drug administration and compatibility, and unique toxicities that should be evaluated when utilizing these therapies. The purpose of this review is to summarize practical considerations for pharmacotherapy in patients with COVID-19, with the intent of serving as a resource for health care providers at the forefront of clinical care during this pandemic.	32259313	Pharmacotherapy	1875-9114	10.1002/phar.2398

The potential of low molecular weight heparin to mitigatie cytokine storm in severe covid-19 patients: a retrospective clinical study	https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.28.20046144	01/04/2020	Artigo completo publicado em periódico científico	10.1101/2020.03.28.20046144	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	['Heparina']	['Heparin']	On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared its assessment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic. However, specific anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) drugs are still under development, and patients are managed by multiple complementary treatments. We performed a retrospective analysis to compare and evaluate the effect of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) treatment on disease progression. For this purpose, the clinical records and laboratory indicators were extracted from electronic medical records of 42 patients with COVID-19 (21 of whom were treated with LMWH, and 21 without LMWH) hospitalized (Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology) from February 1 to March 15, 2020. Changes in the percentage of lymphocytes before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (P = 0.011). Likewise, changes in the levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen degradation products in the LMWH group before and after treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (P = 0.035). Remarkably, IL-6 levels were significantly reduced after LMWH treatment (P = 0.006), indicating that, besides other beneficial properties, LMWH may exert an anti-inflammatory effect and attenuate in part the "cytokine storm" induced by the virus. Our results support the use of LMWH as a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of COVID-19, paving the way for a subsequent well-controlled clinical study.	32881340	Clinical and translational science	1752-8062	10.1111/cts.12880

Prior findings in various viral respiratory diseases including SARS-CoV-related pneumonia suggest that convalescent plasma can reduce mortality, although formal proof of efficacy is still lacking. By reducing viral spread early on, such an approach may possibly downplay subsequent immunopathology. Identifying, collecting, qualifying and preparing plasma from convalescent patients with adequate SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing Ab titres in an acute crisis setting may be challenging, although well within the remit of most blood establishments. Careful clinical evaluation should allow to quickly establish whether such passive immunotherapy, administered at early phases of the disease in patients at high risk of deleterious evolution, may reduce the frequency of patient deterioration, and thereby COVID-19 mortality.	32240545	Vox sanguinis	1423-0410	10.1111/vox.12926
